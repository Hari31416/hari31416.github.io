<p><span m="4000">All right. Good morning all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="8000">Today we embark on another new chapter in what we do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="17000">And the topic is going to be --</span> <span m="41000">We will talk about this thing called an Operational Amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="46000">Before I get into the lecture, I want to point out a couple of</span> <span m="51000">things. One is that you are going to</span> <span m="54000">hear about two big words in today's lecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="59000">Two big and incredibly important words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="62000">And I want to mention those words to you right now so that</span> <span m="68000">when I come to them in lecture you can say OK,</span> <span m="72000">I better pay really close attention, these are important</span> <span m="77000">words. All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="79000">One of them is abstraction. The second one is feedback.</span> </p>
<p><span m="84000">Two incredibly important concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="89000">Abstraction, you have been seeing a couple</span> <span m="92000">times during this course, once in the beginning where we</span> <span m="96000">abstracted out Maxwell's equations by focusing on a</span> <span m="99000">smaller playground and simply using KVL, KCL in place of those</span> <span m="104000">equations. A big abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106000">It turns out that almost all of EECS is based upon abstractions</span> <span m="111000">at various levels. In the first lecture,</span> <span m="113000">I also showed you the layer upon layer of abstraction that</span> <span m="118000">we built to be able to build interesting systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="123000">The second big thing is feedback.</span> </p>
<p><span m="126000">And I am going to relate this to anti-lock breaks in cars.</span> </p>
<p><span m="131000">And so, you can wait and see how we do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="136000">It's an incredibly important concept.</span> </p>
<p><span m="139000">Before we dive into the amplifier abstraction,</span> <span m="144000">let me first talk about something that you know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="150000">Start with something that you know and then lead up into the</span> <span m="154000">operational amplifier and its circuits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="157000">You know about the MOSFET amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="166000">The MOSFET amplifier that you know about looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174000">It was based on a MOSFET.</span> </p>
<p><span m="183000">There was a VS supply. There was a vI input,</span> <span m="189000">a vO output and, as I said, a VS supply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194000">So, this was a MOSFET circuit that you've seen before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="202000">One way of viewing this is that this circuit has three major</span> <span m="210000">ports. This here is the input port</span> <span m="215000">with voltage vI. This here, between the drain</span> <span m="218000">terminal and the ground, is the output port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="222000">I take the output between the drain terminal and ground.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227000">And, finally, we have a third port,</span> <span m="230000">which is this one. It is called the power port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="233000">I apply VS between this terminal here and the ground</span> <span m="238000">terminal. And that gives us the power</span> <span m="242000">port. This device here was a three</span> <span m="244000">port device. Input port or control port,</span> <span m="248000">output port and a power port. And so we looked at the circuit</span> <span m="252000">and did a whole bunch of analyses of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="256000">Then what I can do at this point, now that you've seen</span> <span m="260000">this, it's often times interesting to think about</span> <span m="264000">abstracting this out into some kind of a building block.</span> </p>
<p><span m="270000">Much like in software, you write a procedure and you</span> <span m="273000">abstract out the internal details of the procedure in the</span> <span m="277000">procedure declaration and in the call that you make.</span> </p>
<p><span m="281000">In the same way, we can take this little device</span> <span m="284000">here and abstract that out into the following abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="294000">We could abstract that out as a device that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="306000">I have my input port, I have my output port and I</span> <span m="312000">have my power port. So, I can apply VS here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="318000">Notice that I've taken these six terminals here,</span> <span m="325000">one, two, three, four, five and six,</span> <span m="330000">and put a box around it. And just exposed the terminals</span> <span m="337000">to you. And I need to tell you a little</span> <span m="339000">bit more about the internal properties, but suffice it to</span> <span m="343000">say that you can begin working with this little block.</span> </p>
<p><span m="346000">An even simpler version of this for many applications might just</span> <span m="351000">look like this, vI and vO where there is a</span> <span m="353000">ground that is shared among them that is implicit in this</span> <span m="357000">picture. And vI and vO can simply be the</span> <span m="361000">node voltages at these nodes. This is a progressively more</span> <span m="365000">abstract representation of this amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="368000">What we can do is, provided we know,</span> <span m="371000">we can abstract out the relevant properties of this</span> <span m="374000">block and expose them outside. And the relevant properties</span> <span m="379000">might well be that, let's say here the properties</span> <span m="382000">may be that I in is always zero. I can also express to you the</span> <span m="387000">gain of this amplifier. I may also be able to tell you</span> <span m="393000">the Thevenin equivalent for the output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="397000">There are some properties that I can give you that will let you</span> <span m="404000">use this building block abstractly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="408000">Today, what we will do is introduce a powerful abstraction</span> <span m="415000">of a type of amplifier. This is called the operational</span> <span m="421000">amplifier or "op amp" for short. What I am going to do is give</span> <span m="429000">you a slightly more involved building block than the one I</span> <span m="435000">have shown you there. But suffice it to say that the</span> <span m="441000">idea is going to be the same. This building block looks like</span> <span m="448000">this. This building block has an</span> <span m="451000">input port. This building block also has a</span> <span m="457000">port in which to connect power or the power port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="463000">And the way I am going to connect power,</span> <span m="467000">I am going to connect a plus VS supply here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="472000">That is going to be my ground node.</span> </p>
<p><span m="476000">And I am going to connect a minus VS supply to this node</span> <span m="483000">here. So, these voltages are both VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="488000">I want to apply a plus VS here and a negative VS out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="494000">And I am going to take the output between the ground node</span> <span m="501000">and the output node of the operational amplifier and call</span> <span m="507000">that a vO. This is the output port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="512000">So, input port and output port and a power port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="515000">Think of this as a pattern where I have an input port</span> <span m="519000">across which I connect the input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522000">I have a power port across which I connect a plus VS,</span> <span m="526000">minus VS supply, and then I take the output</span> <span m="529000">terminal and take a ground terminal, which is defined by</span> <span m="534000">external components of my circuitry, and use this as my</span> <span m="538000">reference node. Remember ground is just a</span> <span m="542000">reference node. I am going to use this as a</span> <span m="546000">reference node. These two are equal in</span> <span m="549000">magnitude. And take this as my output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="551000">And when I do something like this, I can build an even</span> <span m="556000">simpler, so this is an abstract differential input amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="560000">In other words, this amplifier is going to</span> <span m="563000">amplify whatever I apply at the input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="566000">A slightly more abstract representation of this looks</span> <span m="570000">like this. vOUT and plus/minus vIN.</span> </p>
<p><span m="574000">This is a slightly more abstract representation where,</span> <span m="578000">remember, we are going to draw this again and again,</span> <span m="582000">maybe at least 38 or 39 times in this course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="586000">And, remember, each time you draw it,</span> <span m="589000">remember that there is an implicit power port,</span> <span m="592000">a plus/minus supply that is connected which we don't show.</span> </p>
<p><span m="598000">And I remember when I first learned about it a long time ago</span> <span m="602000">there was a confusion in me initially.</span> </p>
<p><span m="605000">How does this work? Where is the power coming from?</span> </p>
<p><span m="608000">Just remember that power comes from a plus/minus supply,</span> <span m="613000">and we just don't show that in this abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="616000">Now, the details, a lot of details are in Chapter</span> <span m="620000">16 of your course notes. That's the reading for that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="624000">The other thing is that there are some other key properties of</span> <span m="628000">this amplifier. And let me discuss those very</span> <span m="635000">quickly. First of all,</span> <span m="637000">I can draw a circuit model for the amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="644000">Make some room for myself here. And this is a circuit model for</span> <span m="652000">what we call the ideal operational amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660000">And the circuit model is going to look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="663000">This is an abstract device. And, in terms of analyzing how</span> <span m="668000">this behaves in a circuit, I am going to show you this</span> <span m="672000">abstract circuit that looks as follows.</span> </p>
<p><span m="675000">Some input v is applied at these two terminals here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="679000">And this terminal is called my v plus terminal and this is</span> <span m="683000">called my v minus terminal, so this corresponds to these</span> <span m="687000">two terminals. I am telling you that the</span> <span m="692000">current going in is going to be zero, so i plus is going to be</span> <span m="696000">zero and i minus is going to be zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="699000">i plus is the current in here and i minus is the current into</span> <span m="704000">the v minus terminal, and both these currents are</span> <span m="708000">going to be zero in this device here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="711000">The output is going to look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="714000">Let me just call it vOUT to be consistent with this here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="720000">And taken with ground as my reference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="723000">The output is simply Av. In other words,</span> <span m="727000">what I am doing is I am going to model this as a device that</span> <span m="732000">has a dependent source at its output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="736000">And the dependent source here is a voltage controlled voltage</span> <span m="742000">source. It is a dependent source,</span> <span m="745000">it is a voltage controlled voltage source such that the</span> <span m="750000">output voltage is A times the voltage v across its input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757000">This is actually very simple. Think of these three terminals</span> <span m="762000">I have shown you here. I applied input across these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="766000">And the output is going to be A times whatever I applied.</span> </p>
<p><span m="771000">And A is going to tend towards infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774000">A is going to be huge. And specific values for A might</span> <span m="779000">be a hundred thousand or a million or things of that sort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="785000">Huge A in this abstract amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="789000">In addition to that, the other properties are that</span> <span m="795000">it is going to have infinite input resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801000">That means looking in this looks like an open circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="810000">The fact that this is open here implies the infinite input</span> <span m="815000">resistance across this port. What about the output here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="820000">Remember, this is a voltage source.</span> </p>
<p><span m="824000">And we have a zero output resistance, which means that no</span> <span m="829000">matter how the load affects this, as I apply a load this is</span> <span m="835000">going to behave like an ideal voltage source and keep holding</span> <span m="841000">the voltage constant based on whatever the function I</span> <span m="846000">establish here. And A is virtually infinite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="850000">Let me pause there for a few seconds and just dwell on this</span> <span m="854000">so you just understand what the basic device is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="857000">Following this basic definition, I am just going to</span> <span m="860000">build a whole bunch of fun little circuits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="863000">The analysis will be pretty straightforward,</span> <span m="866000">but this is a big conceptual leap here where there is some</span> <span m="870000">circuitry inside. Containing resistors,</span> <span m="873000">MOSFETs, a whole bunch of stuff in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="876000">I am not telling you what is inside it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="879000">Much like I could build an abstract amplifier,</span> <span m="882000">I could put an abstract box around the amplifier you saw</span> <span m="886000">earlier, I want to put a box around some circuitry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="890000">I am not telling you what the circuitry is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="893000">And, if you are curious, you should look at page 581 of</span> <span m="897000">your course notes. There is an example solved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902000">The example is for a differential amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907000">This is the small signal analysis chapter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="911000">That differential amplifier that's solved in that example is</span> <span m="917000">usually the first stage in an operational amplifier circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="923000">That differential amplifier is the first stage at the input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="930000">And that differential amplifier, as the name implies,</span> <span m="934000">amplifies not a single voltage but amplifies a differential</span> <span m="939000">voltage. Note that this guy amplifies</span> <span m="942000">the voltage difference between these two terminals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="946000">That's v here. And v is simply the same as v</span> <span m="950000">plus minus v minus. It's the node voltage here</span> <span m="954000">minus the node voltage here. That is what's amplified.</span> </p>
<p><span m="960000">It amplifies a difference. Therefore, it is called a</span> <span m="963000">difference amplifier or a differential amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="966000">And so that input stage is what is inside the op amp.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970000">It's got a bunch of other circuitry like level shifters</span> <span m="973000">and so on. And at the output it has got a</span> <span m="976000">buffer. At at the output it has</span> <span m="978000">something that is reminiscent of the source follower circuit that</span> <span m="983000">you learned about in recitations, solved an example</span> <span m="986000">in the course notes and in your homework as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="991000">And you solved a variant of the source follower on your quiz as</span> <span m="995000">well in problem two. So, a circuit that looks like</span> <span m="998000">that appears at the output. Remember, for the source</span> <span m="1002000">follower, the resistance looking in from the output was very,</span> <span m="1006000">very small. You have seen some of the</span> <span m="1009000">pieces that go inside the amplifier, but we will deal with</span> <span m="1013000">this as a building block and simply represent it using this</span> <span m="1017000">abstract little circuit. To dwell on this a little</span> <span m="1022000">longer, this little device here is the workhorse of the analog</span> <span m="1026000">industry. Much like your primitive gate</span> <span m="1030000">abstraction, your inverter and NAND gate and so on,</span> <span m="1034000">much as your primitive inverter or NAND gate was from the</span> <span m="1038000">foundations of the digital industry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1041000">Remember we learned how to build this little abstract</span> <span m="1045000">device called a NAND gate or an inverter?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050000">We noticed that those form the foundations of very complicated</span> <span m="1054000">microprocessors. Those were the building blocks</span> <span m="1058000">of the digital industry. In the same way,</span> <span m="1061000">this little beast here is the building block of the analog</span> <span m="1065000">industry. Just to give you an analogy</span> <span m="1067000">from software, think of this abstract little</span> <span m="1071000">device as a library routine from a library of functions when you</span> <span m="1075000">program in C++ or whatever. Can someone give me an example</span> <span m="1081000">of an incredibly popular routine that we use all the time that</span> <span m="1086000">may be called the workhorse of the software industry?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1091000">Pardon? An abstraction,</span> <span m="1093000">an abstract procedure. One example might be something</span> <span m="1097000">like a printf. Printf is an abstract name for</span> <span m="1101000">a procedure that goes and does something for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105000">It is amazing how we take the lowly printf for granted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1111000">I stick my printf into my program, it includes the</span> <span m="1114000">standard IO library and it goes and prints a value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1117000">You won't believe how complicated the printf is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1120000">As you go into learning more advanced software subjects,</span> <span m="1123000">implementing the printf is a nightmare.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1126000">It is horrendously complicated. Just imagine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1128000">You give it a string and it has to go and print that on your</span> <span m="1132000">terminal or on your Windows system or whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1135000">Think of the complicated steps it has to go through.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140000">But, as far as you're concerned, it's simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1142000">Just print out something and you're done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145000">The same way. Think of this as the printf of</span> <span m="1148000">the analog business. It is really simple,</span> <span m="1150000">and the analysis is going to be incredibly simple,</span> <span m="1153000">it will be mind-bogglingly simple, but inside it,</span> <span m="1157000">heavens forbid if you look inside it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159000">Tell you what, go into to S-T-D-I-O dot in one</span> <span m="1162000">of the library routines and just pore through printf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165000">The world's worst horrendous macros are in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1170000">I mean it is just nasty. The same way inside the op amp,</span> <span m="1173000">it is nasty. You don't want to go there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175000">Much like in your C programming in your classes,</span> <span m="1178000">you were able to use printf without fully knowing how it was</span> <span m="1182000">implemented. Probably some MIT god or some</span> <span m="1185000">key graduate implemented it, but once it was implemented you</span> <span m="1188000">just used it based on simple abstract rules as to how it</span> <span m="1192000">behaved. You didn't have to know what</span> <span m="1194000">was inside it to use it. The same way with the</span> <span m="1197000">operational amplifier. So, just think of printf when</span> <span m="1202000">you see this and just imagine how simple it is going to be to</span> <span m="1206000">use it. You may think that I spend way</span> <span m="1209000">too much time, ten minutes dwelling on this</span> <span m="1212000">abstract concept, but I like to dwell on things</span> <span m="1215000">that I think are incredibly important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1218000">The concept of abstraction is very important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1221000">And it's not just in software. The concept of abstraction</span> <span m="1225000">pervades all of EECS. And if I were to give you a</span> <span m="1230000">project to say go and ask every professor what is the one word</span> <span m="1234000">that you think best describes all of EECS?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1238000">Just pick one word. Go ask every single professor</span> <span m="1241000">you know. What is a single word?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1244000">If you were to characterize all of EECS with just one word,</span> <span m="1248000">what might that word be? In my mind, it is the A word,</span> <span m="1252000">abstraction. It is all over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1254000">If you do a grep on all the words used by all your</span> <span m="1258000">professors in your four years here, I promise you the first</span> <span m="1263000">one will be know. And the second one will be</span> <span m="1268000">abstraction. Check it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1270000">See if what I am saying is true or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273000">It is all over the place. In 6.001, how many times do you</span> <span m="1277000">think the word abstraction was used in 6.001?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1281000">It's all over the map. It's the A word all over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1285000">Imagine your shock when you see it being used in 002 because the</span> <span m="1290000">same concept applies. We build more complicated</span> <span m="1295000">systems by abstracting out the details of lesser objects,</span> <span m="1300000">and then using those to build the more complicated systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1305000">Abstraction is a very powerful mechanism of dealing with</span> <span m="1310000">complexity. Next step is how do I go about</span> <span m="1314000">using the op amp? Let me show you how it looks on</span> <span m="1318000">a scope. What I am going to do is apply</span> <span m="1323000">input to the op amp, I am going to look at the</span> <span m="1329000">output, place the resistor RL to ground and look at the output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1337000">And here I am going to apply a plus VS and out here a minus VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1345000">Again, remember that a plus VS simply looks like this and a</span> <span m="1352000">minus VS simply looks like this. It's just an inverted VS</span> <span m="1360000">applied here so I get a minus VS at this input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1365000">First of all, what I would like to do is as I</span> <span m="1370000">change vIN, I am going to plot for you how vOUT looks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1377000">vIN and this is vO. I am going to plot vIN in terms</span> <span m="1383000">of microvolts and vO in volts. vIN is going to have a very</span> <span m="1388000">very small, the scale is going to be in microvolts because</span> <span m="1394000">remember the gain of this is huge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1397000">It's on the order of ten to the sixth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1401000">It's huge. Small changes in vIN are going</span> <span m="1405000">to cause massive changes in vO. I have a very fine scale on the</span> <span m="1412000">X axis. What is going to happen if I</span> <span m="1416000">somehow magically make vIN exactly zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419000">If I short these two terminals, if this was a completely ideal</span> <span m="1425000">op amp, which it never is, if it's a completely ideal op</span> <span m="1430000">amp, then my output should be zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1433000">As I increase my vIN the output should be A times vIN.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1440000">For some small value of vIN, small v, let's say one</span> <span m="1443000">microvolt, the output should be one volt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1446000">A is a constant so this would look like a straight line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1450000">And let's say my supply voltages are 12 volts minus 12</span> <span m="1454000">volts, if this were an ideal amplifier and I didn't have to</span> <span m="1459000">worry about the supply, this would just go on extending</span> <span m="1463000">forever. But I have a plus 12 volt</span> <span m="1465000">supply and a minus 12 volt supply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1467000">My output cannot go past those limits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472000">And so, therefore, my output kind of flattens out</span> <span m="1475000">at these two points. And it is called hitting the</span> <span m="1479000">rails. Output goes up and you hear a</span> <span m="1482000">thunk sound and you hit the rails.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1485000">When you play with op amps in your next lab,</span> <span m="1489000">if you listen really, really carefully you may hear</span> <span m="1493000">it. So, this saturates out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495000">Not surprisingly, this region where the output</span> <span m="1499000">saturates at the supply is called the saturation region.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1505000">Remember, don't confuse it with-- It's not the same as your</span> <span m="1509000">saturation in the MOSFET. It is a totally different</span> <span m="1513000">thing. It is just happenstance that we</span> <span m="1516000">call this saturation. And if you would like to think</span> <span m="1520000">about it, you can think of it as the thunk region.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1524000">That's probably more appropriate to distinguish it</span> <span m="1527000">from the saturation region in the MOSFET.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532000">And, not surprisingly, this one is called the active</span> <span m="1536000">region. And it is in this region that</span> <span m="1539000">we use the op amp. Here it has hit the rails and</span> <span m="1543000">is kind of dangling out there. It's not much use to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1548000">It's in this active region that we use it because this is where</span> <span m="1553000">the gain is seen. Now, it turns out that this is</span> <span m="1558000">a very high gain device. It is very skittish.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561000">This gain is kind of a really funny thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1565000">It's dependent on a bunch of factors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1568000">This could be temperature dependent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570000">This gain here and this curve is just completely skittish.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1575000">It could depend on temperature. It could depend on time of day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1580000">It could depend on what medication this amplifier is on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1584000">It could depend on its mood swings.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1587000">Who knows what? This is kind of unstable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1592000">And A in particular is highly unstable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1594000">It is going to be big, that's for sure,</span> <span m="1596000">but it could be ten to the six, on a rainy day it might be two</span> <span m="1600000">times ten to the six. If it feeling sleepy it may be</span> <span m="1603000">point five times ten to the sixth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1606000">It is big but I cannot rely on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1608000">Let me show you an example. I want to show you this curve</span> <span m="1611000">for this MOSFET, apply an input and plotting the</span> <span m="1614000">output. What I will do is take a look</span> <span m="1616000">at this curve. Then what I am going to do is</span> <span m="1620000">use a heat gun to heat the op amp and you are going to see</span> <span m="1624000">this vary all over the map. If you still remember last</span> <span m="1627000">week, some of you may remember that from some place in a</span> <span m="1631000">similar situation where the gm for the MOSFETs you were given</span> <span m="1635000">was also dependent on temperature and stuff like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1638000">It is a very common occurrence. And that is certainly the case</span> <span m="1642000">for the MOSFET.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1651000">Let's apply input. Let's do this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1654000">This is vIN versus vOUT for the amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1658000">Notice that this is plus 12 volts, this is minus 12 volts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1664000">It is about two volts per division.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667000">This axis here is in microvolts, I believe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1672000">For a very small change, for a few tens of microvolts,</span> <span m="1677000">I have an incredibly high gain. Notice that this has an</span> <span m="1683000">incredibly high gain here. The gain is the slope of this</span> <span m="1687000">line, almost a vertical line. What I am going to do next,</span> <span m="1691000">is to have some fun, is I am going to heat the op</span> <span m="1694000">amp. To show you that A is kind of</span> <span m="1696000">really skittish and also the fact that it doesn't quite hit</span> <span m="1700000">zero, it does all kinds of weird things, I am going to heat the</span> <span m="1704000">op amp. And then let's take a look at</span> <span m="1707000">how that curve fluctuates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1740000">What you saw there was that the op amp began to behave really</span> <span m="1744000">weirdly as I heated it. Instead of doing this it</span> <span m="1747000">sometimes did this really weirdly, like getting an offset</span> <span m="1751000">from the center and so on. And it does a bunch of other</span> <span m="1755000">weird things, but we won't go into those</span> <span m="1758000">details. It's not relevant for this</span> <span m="1761000">course. But the point is that the gain</span> <span m="1763000">and the offset at the input are dependent on temperature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1769000">And we look for ways to make it less dependent on temperature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1773000">As the next step, what I would like to do is</span> <span m="1777000">build a circuit. This is model equivalent of</span> <span m="1780000">your Hello World program. We are going to use the printf</span> <span m="1784000">and build a small program on the printf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1787000">You don't have to worry about how printf is implemented,</span> <span m="1791000">just that we can build very highly interesting circuits with</span> <span m="1796000">this horrendously complicated function based on a simple</span> <span m="1800000">abstraction of the device. The circuit that we will build</span> <span m="1808000">is called a noninverting amplifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820000">From now on, I am not going to show you the</span> <span m="1822000">plus/minus VS. I am not going to show the</span> <span m="1825000">power port, but it is in there. It's hidden under the</span> <span m="1828000">abstraction layer. This is my op amp.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1831000">And I am going to build the following circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1835000">This is my v plus and this is my v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1838000">What I am going to do is for the v plus I shall apply a vIN.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1843000">Let me talk a little bit about ground as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847000">Ground is commonly taken as the point at which I connect my VS</span> <span m="1852000">and minus VS supply. It is kind of at the midpoint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1858000">And if VS and minus VS are very carefully tuned then the output</span> <span m="1863000">is also going to be at that same ground reference when the input</span> <span m="1868000">is zero. So, the ground is defined as</span> <span m="1871000">the point at which I connect my plus/minus VS supplies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1876000">I apply my vIN out here. Then what I am going to do,</span> <span m="1880000">here is my output vO. I am going to have a resistive</span> <span m="1884000">divider to ground here and label these R1 and R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1890000">And what I am going to do here is feed this back to the input,</span> <span m="1896000">to the v minus input. I am going to sample the</span> <span m="1900000">voltage here and feed that into here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1904000">So, this is my abstract model and this is my Hello World</span> <span m="1909000">program. What we are going to do is</span> <span m="1913000">simply analyze how this little program behaves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1919000">So, my equivalent circuit model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1920000">The way to analyze these is after one or two of these</span> <span m="1923000">examples, you will be able to directly analyze this just by</span> <span m="1927000">looking at it, by inspection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1929000">But, much as we did for the other pieces,</span> <span m="1931000">let me grunge through drawing the equivalent circuit and</span> <span m="1934000">grinding through the analysis, and then show you the much</span> <span m="1938000">simpler way of doing it. And even here,</span> <span m="1940000">even with this grinding analysis, it is going to be</span> <span m="1943000">pretty simple in any case. So, I will replace the op amp</span> <span m="1946000">with its equivalent circuit model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1950000">Its equivalent circuit was v plus, v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1964000">So, that was the equivalent circuit model of the operational</span> <span m="1969000">amplifier, just this piece. I draw that for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1973000">Then what I am going to do is I connect my v in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979000">And, remember, I have an R1,</span> <span m="1982000">R2 resistive divider here. And this one gets connected to</span> <span m="1989000">this terminal there. I also know that i plus is</span> <span m="1994000">zero. I also know that i minus is</span> <span m="1998000">zero. All I've done is simply</span> <span m="2002000">replaced the amplifier with its equivalent circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010000">Let's go ahead and analyze that circuit now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2014000">Let's go ahead and analyze that circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018000">And it's going to be pretty simple, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022000">What I am going to show you is the hard way of doing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028000">I will show you a much easier way, but the hard way itself is</span> <span m="2034000">pathetically easy. What I want to do is find vO in</span> <span m="2039000">terms of vIN. And there will be a bunch of</span> <span m="2044000">other factors thrown in, including things like R1 and</span> <span m="2048000">R2, A and stuff like that. Let's go and analyze it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2052000">vO, let's look at that circuit. By the way, let me take 30</span> <span m="2056000">seconds and make a little speech at this point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060000">When you see circuits like this, and I saw this happen in</span> <span m="2064000">quiz two as well, for some reason,</span> <span m="2067000">when you see a new kind of circuit, don't completely go</span> <span m="2071000">berserk or freeze or whatever. There is just no reason to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2076000">You know the node method. The node method is the</span> <span m="2079000">workhorse of our business. When in doubt apply the node</span> <span m="2083000">method. It will simply work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085000">Don't freeze. Don't think oh,</span> <span m="2087000">man, I need to apply a pattern that I know already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2090000">I must have seen this somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2092000">When in doubt boom, apply the node method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2096000">This circuit here, all I have here is one unknown</span> <span m="2100000">node voltage. I know the voltage of v plus,</span> <span m="2103000">I need to compute the voltage vO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2106000">There are two unknowns, vO is an unknown and the</span> <span m="2110000">voltage here at v minus is another unknown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2114000">This is a very simple circuit involving a dependent voltage</span> <span m="2118000">controlled voltage source, and you need to find out vO and</span> <span m="2123000">v minus using the node method. Just apply it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2127000">It's simple. Don't freeze.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131000">Just look at it and say I can do it and apply the node method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2136000">It will simply work. So, let's do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2140000">What I can do here is vO is A times v plus minus v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2145000">This is actually really simple. And then, if I take v plus</span> <span m="2150000">here, I know v plus is simply vIN so I will just make that</span> <span m="2155000">substitution right away. So, v plus is simply vIN.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2161000">What is v minus? v minus here is vO --</span> <span m="2185000">What is v plus? I'm sorry, v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2187000">v minus is simply the voltage that is between R1 and R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2193000">Notice that no current flows in to the v minus node.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2197000">There is no current flowing in. Voltage at v minus is simply</span> <span m="2202000">the voltage given by the resistive divider,</span> <span m="2206000">which is vO times R2 divided by R1 plus R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210000">Stare at that for another second.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2212000">The voltage at this node here is simply given by the resistive</span> <span m="2218000">divider. Because no current is flowing</span> <span m="2222000">in this direction. And no current flows in because</span> <span m="2226000">I am telling you there is no current there based on my</span> <span m="2230000">abstraction. I am telling you i minus is</span> <span m="2234000">zero. That voltage is simply the</span> <span m="2236000">voltage at this resistive divider.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239000">And so I can simplify it further and write this as vO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2243000">So I get, there is a one here. And I move this thing over to</span> <span m="2248000">this side so I get one plus A times R2 divided by R1 plus R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2255000">And that is equal to AvIN. And simplifying it some more,</span> <span m="2262000">I get vO is AvIN divided by one plus AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271000">Notice how simple this is, and this is the hard method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2280000">All I have done is analyze the circuit using the basic circuit</span> <span m="2285000">analysis principle that you learned the first week of the</span> <span m="2289000">course, and I have the output for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2292000">I just noted very carefully what the relationships were</span> <span m="2297000">between the various elements in the abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300000">Notice here that I am told that A is extremely large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2305000">A is on the order of ten to the six and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2310000">And suppose it is the case that, let me write that down</span> <span m="2316000">again. vO is AvIN, one plus AR2,</span> <span m="2320000">R2. Suppose R1 and R2 are more or</span> <span m="2324000">less comparable and A is ten to the six, it's a huge number,</span> <span m="2332000">so this whole number is much, much greater than one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2340000">If it is much huger than one, what I can do is I can then</span> <span m="2346000">write this as follows. I can say that this is more or</span> <span m="2353000">less equal to AvIN divided by AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2360000">I am ignoring the one here. As soon as I do that,</span> <span m="2366000">notice I can cancel out A and I get vO to be approximately equal</span> <span m="2374000">to vIN times R1 plus R2 divided by R2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2380000">Notice now that when the gain is very large the output is a</span> <span m="2385000">function of the input multiplied by some number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389000">The beauty of this thing here is that when A is very large,</span> <span m="2394000">or this expression is very large, A cancels out and there</span> <span m="2399000">is no A in this relationship. This means that even though the</span> <span m="2406000">basic amplifier was very skittish, the output here</span> <span m="2411000">relates to the input based on components that I have control</span> <span m="2416000">over. These are soldiers in my army.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420000">I control them. So, to give you a sense of some</span> <span m="2425000">numbers here, suppose A was ten to the six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2429000">And I choose R1 to be 9R. And R to be some R.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435000">Then vO is ten to the sixth vIN divided by one plus ten to the</span> <span m="2444000">six R divided by 9R plus R. So, that is ten to the six vIN</span> <span m="2452000">divided by one plus ten to the six divided by ten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2461000">All right. If I ignore the one here,</span> <span m="2465000">the ten to the six and ten to the six cancel out,</span> <span m="2471000">this ends up giving me 10vIN. So, I get a really nice</span> <span m="2477000">amplifier whose output is simply ten times the input and</span> <span m="2483000">determined solely by some resistor values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490000">Let me show you another quick demo this time and show you the</span> <span m="2494000">amplifier again, but with resistors connected</span> <span m="2497000">like that. And then I show you that I want</span> <span m="2501000">to heat the amplifier to the wazoo, the op amp to the wazoo,</span> <span m="2505000">but vO is going to be absolutely rock solid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2508000">Let's try that out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2520000">This time around, this is the transfer function,</span> <span m="2523000">the vO versus vIN. And notice that this time</span> <span m="2527000">around I have similar scales on the X and Y axes,</span> <span m="2531000">and this has a slope of 10. This is the point where the</span> <span m="2535000">amplifier saturates at plus 12 volts, and this is minus 12</span> <span m="2540000">volts, and this point here is a zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543000">So, this is vIN, vOUT, plus 12,</span> <span m="2545000">minus 12 and this slope is 10. What I am going to do now is</span> <span m="2551000">heat the op amp to the wazoo and this ain't going to change</span> <span m="2556000">because it's my external resistors that control it</span> <span m="2560000">independent of the value of A, provided A continues to be very</span> <span m="2565000">large. I am just articulating the</span> <span m="2567000">vOUT, vIN curve. And let me start heating the op</span> <span m="2571000">amp.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2581000">Notice that it's pretty stable. It doesn't change because it is</span> <span m="2586000">independent of the amplifier values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2589000">What I have done now is by connecting these resistors in</span> <span m="2594000">this way, I have a nice amplifier with a gain of ten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2598000">The question you may ask yourselves is why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2602000">There is this little sucker in there that wants to shoot things</span> <span m="2607000">up by ten to the sixth. Wants to knock things off the</span> <span m="2612000">one rail or the negative rail. Why is it that it's behaving</span> <span m="2616000">like a docile lamb here and giving us a nice little factor</span> <span m="2619000">of ten gain no matter what I do to it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2621000">Why is it doing that? What is the intuition behind</span> <span m="2624000">it? I will draw something on the</span> <span m="2626000">board, but for the next ten seconds I want you think about</span> <span m="2630000">it. See if you can come up with</span> <span m="2631000">some insight as to why is it doing that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2634000">Why is it exactly ten? Why isn't the ten to the sixth</span> <span m="2637000">kind of killing me somehow? Why am I getting exactly ten no</span> <span m="2641000">matter what happens? See if you can come up with</span> <span m="2644000">some intuition and then I will show you how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647000">I will redraw the circuit in the meantime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2668000">Let me see if I can give you some intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670000">This is my circuit, and let's say this is R and</span> <span m="2674000">this is R. As an example,</span> <span m="2676000">let's assume that the input is 5 volts, vIN is 5 volts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2682000">If R and R are equal, what should the output be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686000">It's R and R, so it's R1 plus R2 divided by</span> <span m="2690000">R2, right? It's 2R divided by R,</span> <span m="2693000">so it has a gain of two. My amplifier has a gain of two</span> <span m="2699000">because R1 plus R2 divided by R2, which is my gain,</span> <span m="2703000">is R plus R divided by R equals two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2709000">So, this will be 10 volts. If that is 10 volts this is</span> <span m="2713000">going to be 5 volts, correct?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2716000">This R and R, voltage divider,</span> <span m="2718000">this is five, so I get 5 volts here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722000">This is v plus. This is v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724000">I get R and R, 5 volts here,</span> <span m="2727000">that's how the circuit looks. Now let's understand what is</span> <span m="2732000">going on. And listen very carefully.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2734000">This is going to be a key insight that I hope you will</span> <span m="2737000">carry with you for the rest of your lives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2740000">This is really, really key.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741000">What you are going to see is, I think, the third big ah-ha</span> <span m="2745000">moment in 6.002. Like small signal analysis,</span> <span m="2747000">like the frequency domain stuff we saw, I think this is the</span> <span m="2751000">third big one in the next 30 or 40 seconds, things that are</span> <span m="2754000">completely either not necessarily intuitive but are</span> <span m="2757000">just spectacular in terms of what they can do for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2762000">Let's see. Let's suppose that because I am</span> <span m="2764000">heating it, let's suppose that A suddenly tends to increase.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2768000">It wants to increase because I have heated it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2771000">A is saying I want to get out this mold here and starts to</span> <span m="2775000">break through its shackles here. Let's say, as a Gedanken</span> <span m="2779000">experiment, that it tries to shoot up this to 12 volts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782000">It tries to push it up higher. This is just a Gedanken</span> <span m="2786000">experiment. The up arrow says that the</span> <span m="2790000">increase in A is trying to push up vO momentarily.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2794000">Let's see what happens. It is trying to push up vO</span> <span m="2798000">momentarily, so let's say this goes to 12 hypothetically.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2803000">If that goes to 12, what should this volt node go</span> <span m="2807000">to? Six, exactly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809000">This goes to 6 volts. If that goes to six,</span> <span m="2812000">what does v minus go to? 6 volts again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2816000">So, v minus goes to 6 volts. Now at the input I have 5 volts</span> <span m="2822000">at v plus and 6 volts at v minus, so where should the</span> <span m="2826000">output go? The output should go down</span> <span m="2829000">because the voltage of the negative terminal is higher.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2833000">And so the output is A times v plus minus v minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837000">And because this has gone down, this has gone up here it is</span> <span m="2842000">going to try to pull the output down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2845000">That is going to pull the output down let's say to 9 volts</span> <span m="2849000">or something. Cachunk, there is a big battle</span> <span m="2854000">going on here. A has gone up,</span> <span m="2855000">it has boosted it up to 12, but the moment that goes to 12,</span> <span m="2859000">this goes to 6, this goes to 6,</span> <span m="2861000">and the op amp output has to go down to 9 volts now because this</span> <span m="2865000">input is higher here. If this goes to 9,</span> <span m="2868000">this goes to 4.5. If that goes to 4.5,</span> <span m="2871000">this goes to 4.5. What happens now?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2873000">If this goes to 4.5, what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2875000">It wants to go back up. Can't it make up its mind?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2880000">This guy wants to go back up now because v plus is higher</span> <span m="2884000">than v minus. What am I seeing here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2887000">This whole circuit here behaves like my little son,</span> <span m="2891000">my 9-year-old. If say do this,</span> <span m="2894000">he wants to do the exact opposite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2897000">So, there is a trick in how you make them do things for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901000">Look at this. Because of this arrangement of</span> <span m="2905000">the circuit when A tries to push the output up,</span> <span m="2909000">the rest of the circuit tries to pull it back down to where it</span> <span m="2914000">used to be. If the circuit tries not to</span> <span m="2919000">follow the true path, the rest of the circuit tries</span> <span m="2923000">to whack it into shape so it follows a true path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2928000">And what's happening is because, in this arrangement,</span> <span m="2932000">I have fed back a portion of the output to the negative</span> <span m="2937000">input. I have fed back some of the</span> <span m="2941000">output to the negative input. And by providing this feedback</span> <span m="2946000">of a portion of the output to the negative input,</span> <span m="2949000">I have arranged it in a way that I have something called</span> <span m="2954000">negative feedback. What negative feedback does is</span> <span m="2958000">that if this wanted to go wild and crazy, the circuit provides</span> <span m="2963000">it with some negative feedback like you just saw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2967000">Feedback, a big word. If you take a poll of all the</span> <span m="2972000">EECS faculty, I suspect that feedback would</span> <span m="2975000">rank at least as the ninth or tenth most important word in the</span> <span m="2979000">EECS. If abstract is number one,</span> <span m="2981000">I think this would rank like a nine or a ten or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2986000">So, that's the reason why it worked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2988000">In the last couple of minutes, let me give you some insight,</span> <span m="2993000">based on something that you know, on how feedback works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2997000">This is a road here. Let's look at anti lock breaks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3002000">This is my tire. And let's say I have a set of</span> <span m="3005000">disk brakes here. As the car is moving forward,</span> <span m="3009000">if I apply the brakes the tire stops rolling,</span> <span m="3013000">but if I apply the breaks too hard it can lock up the tire and</span> <span m="3018000">the whole car can skid. The way anti lock breaks work</span> <span m="3022000">is as follows. There is a controller that sits</span> <span m="3026000">here. And there is a little person</span> <span m="3030000">looking at the wheel and seeing is it turning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3034000">So, this is a feedback. And it is saying is it turning?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3039000">Yes. Or, is it not turning?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3042000">No. All this person watching the</span> <span m="3045000">tire is doing is saying is it turning or is it not turning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3050000">That is it. That is a negative feedback.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3054000">And so, if it is no and if it is yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3059000">If it is yes then what this does is it applies the brakes</span> <span m="3063000">even more strongly. It is turning so I can apply</span> <span m="3066000">more brakes. But if it says oops,</span> <span m="3068000">it stopped turning, what it does is it simply</span> <span m="3071000">releases, the controller releases the brakes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3075000">And when the controller releases the brakes this one</span> <span m="3078000">tends to loosen up a little bit and the tire starts turning</span> <span m="3083000">again. So, this way you are constantly</span> <span m="3085000">keeping the tire in its region of critical friction so that it</span> <span m="3090000">is constantly moving. And static friction applies to</span> <span m="3094000">how hard you can brake and it doesn't start skidding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3097000">In fact, if you take your car out, and I don't say you do</span> <span m="3101000">this. Let's say go onto the Charles</span> <span m="3102000">River in the dead of winter and you drive on the lake and you</span> <span m="3106000">slam your anti lock brakes on, on an icy patch,</span> <span m="3109000">you will notice that there is a constant sound that looks like</span> <span m="3112000">something is vibrating in there. That is exactly what is</span> <span m="3115000">happening. Oops, the tire is locked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3117000">Release the brakes. The wheel is turning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3121000">Jam the brakes on. That is exactly what is</span> <span m="3123000">happening. The same way as out there,</span> <span m="3125000">you notice that oops, the output is going up,</span> <span m="3128000">pull it down, oops, it's going down,</span> <span m="3130000">pull it up. So, there is constant negative</span> <span m="3132000">feedback that is keeping the output stable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3135000">A very important concept. And I will ask your recitation</span> <span m="3138000">instructors to cover the very simple method that is on page 9.</span> </p>

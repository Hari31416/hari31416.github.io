<p><span m="0">Good morning. OK.</span> <span m="1300">Why is it so much lower?</span> <span m="4000">The topic for today is Energy and Power.</span> <span m="24000">Most of the time this semester, up to now at least,</span> <span m="28000">we focused a lot on speed. We have been truly speed freaks</span> <span m="32000">looking at how fast can we switch the signal,</span> <span m="36000">what does a time domain waveform look like?</span> <span m="39000">We also looked at frequency responses of circuits.</span> <span m="44000">This week we will spend on something a little bit</span> <span m="48000">different, and that relates to energy and power.</span> <span m="53000">Energy and power is gaining a lot more importance in certainly</span> <span m="57000">this decade, and will do so in the future.</span> <span m="60000">And I am going to work out a little example towards the end</span> <span m="64000">of the lecture. And there you will see that if</span> <span m="68000">you do things naively, your handheld devices,</span> <span m="71000">your cell phone, laptops and so on will just up</span> <span m="74000">and explode. You have got to be a little bit</span> <span m="78000">careful in terms of how to manage energy and power.</span> <span m="81000">Before I get into that, I just want to wrap up with a</span> <span m="85000">quick review of what we covered last week.</span> <span m="95000">We ended last week by looking at positive feedback in analog</span> <span m="99000">circuits using an op amp. And, in particular,</span> <span m="103000">we built an oscillator.</span> <span m="111000">We built an oscillator that allowed us to charge a</span> <span m="115000">capacitor. And when the voltage across the</span> <span m="118000">capacitor equaled that at the minus terminal it would flip and</span> <span m="122000">keep doing so. And at the output you would get</span> <span m="126000">a waveform that looked like this.</span> <span m="128000">You would get a square wave output.</span> <span m="131000">Now, throughout the course we have talked about getting square</span> <span m="136000">wave inputs. And this is one example of how</span> <span m="139000">you can actually produce a square wave pretty much from</span> <span m="143000">first principles using a capacitor, resistors and an op</span> <span m="147000">amp. Now, I just wanted to wrap up</span> <span m="151000">this little item here by talking about one application of an</span> <span m="156000">oscillator. And this application of the</span> <span m="160000">oscillator really nicely closed the loop on the body of</span> <span m="164000">knowledge relating to digital circuits that we have covered in</span> <span m="170000">this course. What I want to talk about</span> <span m="173000">briefly is a small digital system with a sender and a</span> <span m="178000">receiver. And the sender is sending a</span> <span m="182000">signal, the receiver receives a signal, and in this course we</span> <span m="187000">have talked about senders sending a sequence of ones and</span> <span m="192000">zeros. Say, for example,</span> <span m="194000">the sender wants to send some sort of a signal like this.</span> <span m="199000">We have seen that this is quite a legitimate signal.</span> <span m="203000">We get some kind of oscillatory behavior because of the</span> <span m="208000">inductance and capacitance associated with the wire.</span> <span m="214000">And what you have done is that you pretty much believed me when</span> <span m="217000">I said that this really corresponds to a one,</span> <span m="220000">one, zero. The sender wants to send a one,</span> <span m="222000">one, zero signal to the receiver, and the receiver gets</span> <span m="225000">it. So this is a one,</span> <span m="226000">this is a one, this is a zero.</span> <span m="228000">But if I am a receiver, I am going to look at the</span> <span m="231000">square wave. There is no such thing as</span> <span m="233000">sending a one on a wire. You cannot send a one on a</span> <span m="236000">wire. You send a voltage signal or a</span> <span m="238000">current signal on a wire. So, the receiver receives a</span> <span m="242000">voltage signal. It is going to be zero for some</span> <span m="245000">time and then maybe 5 volts or 3 volts or whatever is your high</span> <span m="249000">and then zero again. How does my receiver know it's</span> <span m="253000">a one, one, zero? Why can't it be a one,</span> <span m="255000">one, one, one, zero, zero, zero?</span> <span m="257000">It doesn't know. How does the receiver know it's</span> <span m="260000">a one, one, zero sequence and not 50 ones followed by 40</span> <span m="264000">zeros? It doesn't know.</span> <span m="265000">What we need is -- For senders to be able to</span> <span m="269000">communicate with receivers, we need some kind of agreed</span> <span m="274000">upon time when receivers sample the signal coming in and decide</span> <span m="278000">whether it's a one or a zero. They both have to agree on</span> <span m="283000">certain time bases when to look at the input.</span> <span m="286000">One way to deal with this is I can have a clock,</span> <span m="290000">a square wave signal that we call a clock in digital systems</span> <span m="294000">and ship it to the other side in the following manner.</span> <span m="306000">This clock signal can be applied to this sender and to</span> <span m="310000">this receiver. For more details on this,</span> <span m="314000">let me recommend Page 735 of the course notes that talks</span> <span m="318000">about a detailed example of the use of a clock in a digital</span> <span m="323000">system. What I can do is create a clock</span> <span m="327000">that looks like the square wave. The clock provides a notion of</span> <span m="333000">time to the circuit. And I have some kind of a clock</span> <span m="336000">signal generator. And I connect that to the</span> <span m="339000">sender and connect that to the receiver.</span> <span m="342000">And now both the receiver and the sender have a notion of</span> <span m="346000">time. And what I can do is I can tell</span> <span m="348000">my receiver, the sender and the receiver can have an agreement</span> <span m="353000">between them that says that look at the signal at your input when</span> <span m="357000">on the rising edge of the clock. Whenever the clock rises,</span> <span m="363000">when you see a rising edge look at the value in the wire and</span> <span m="367000">that's the value I sent. By doing so,</span> <span m="370000">what I can do is that the receiver can look at the signal.</span> <span m="375000">At this rising edge it sees a zero, this is vOH,</span> <span m="379000">looks up here, sees a one here,</span> <span m="381000">sees a one here and sees a zero.</span> <span m="384000">So, it correctly sampled one, one, zero at the receiving end.</span> <span m="390000">And the sender can send the same sequence here once we have</span> <span m="394000">this time base. This little brief foray</span> <span m="397000">circuits was simply to give you an application of a circuit that</span> <span m="401000">can produce a square wave. I can create a clock with a</span> <span m="405000">time base. Also, interestingly much more</span> <span m="408000">fundamental is we looked at various abstractions throughout</span> <span m="412000">the course. We talked about discretizing</span> <span m="415000">space by looking at lumped signals.</span> <span m="419000">What I also want to point out is that a clock can be viewed as</span> <span m="423000">another fundamental abstraction in the digital domain where what</span> <span m="427000">I am doing is discretizing time. What I am saying is that,</span> <span m="431000">look, in the digital domain we have already discretized value</span> <span m="435000">into zeros and ones, but we still had continuous</span> <span m="439000">time until now. And what you do in digital</span> <span m="442000">systems is to say that look, let's digitize everything,</span> <span m="445000">or rather discretize everything.</span> <span m="449000">And let's discretize time as well into these points that</span> <span m="452000">happen on the rising edge of the clock which means that the</span> <span m="456000">circuit has meaning, signals have meaning only when</span> <span m="459000">the clock is rising. That tends to discretize time</span> <span m="463000">which means that I really don't care what happens to signals in</span> <span m="467000">this time, as long as on the rising edge of the clock I get</span> <span m="471000">the right value. This concept is called</span> <span m="473000">discretizing time. And a clock lets you do that.</span> <span m="478000">Remember that in digital systems, which you will learn</span> <span m="481000">about in 004 I am really discretizing two things,</span> <span m="485000">discretizing values into zeros and ones, and at the same time</span> <span m="490000">also discretizing time into a time when I sample things and a</span> <span m="494000">time when I ignore values on the wires.</span> <span m="497000">I think you will get to clocks in 6.004 after about a month,</span> <span m="501000">so initially you would just be focusing on the statics of the</span> <span m="506000">system without worrying about any dynamic clock introduced in</span> <span m="510000">the circuit. OK, that's just a brief little</span> <span m="515000">interlude. With that let me get into</span> <span m="518000">today's topic of energy and power.</span> <span m="520000">Why is this important? The reason this is important is</span> <span m="525000">that what really determines the size of your handheld?</span> <span m="529000">You may think oh, gee, electronics in the</span> <span m="532000">handheld. Some of you may think,</span> <span m="535000">oh, the antenna in the handheld.</span> <span m="537000">No. What really,</span> <span m="539000">really determines the size and weight of your handheld devices,</span> <span m="543000">your PDAs, your cell phones, your laptops and so on is by</span> <span m="547000">and large the battery. On Page 2 I have a little</span> <span m="550000">cartoon that shows you that if we did not have you learn about</span> <span m="553000">energy and power, that's what we would all be</span> <span m="556000">doing in order to use cell phones.</span> <span m="558000">Not surprisingly the very first wireless phones ended up in</span> <span m="562000">automobiles because you had a big battery.</span> <span m="564000">And so you had these wireless phones only in cars.</span> <span m="569000">Because of a huge amount of research based on the knowledge,</span> <span m="572000">the technologies I am going to talk about in today's lecture</span> <span m="576000">and Thursday's lecture, you will see very simple and</span> <span m="580000">elegant ways of reducing the amount of battery you need to be</span> <span m="584000">able to get some kind of function out of analog or</span> <span m="587000">digital devices. I also want you to take a look</span> <span m="590000">at Page 2 of the handout that I have given you here,</span> <span m="594000">handout 63. This handout talks about the</span> <span m="596000">absolute latest in digital fabrication technology out</span> <span m="600000">there. This is not a paid commercial</span> <span m="604000">for IBM. IBM has a technology called</span> <span m="608000">CU08. It is called Blue Logic.</span> <span m="611000">It is called the Copper 08 Process.</span> <span m="614000">And in this process, if you look down on Page 1,</span> <span m="619000">for example, IBM claims that it can build up</span> <span m="623000">to 72 million gates in a single chip.</span> <span m="628000">With this technology they are able to build 70 to 80 million</span> <span m="632000">gates where a gate is, unless otherwise mentioned,</span> <span m="635000">pretty much defined as a two input NAND gate equivalent.</span> <span m="639000">So, your inverter, your NAND gate and so on count</span> <span m="642000">as a gate. And they can build close to 80</span> <span m="645000">million of these little suckers on a single chip.</span> <span m="648000">Just imagine that. And the biggest chip they can</span> <span m="651000">build is on the order of 18 to 19 millimeters on a side,</span> <span m="655000">roughly two centimeters on a side.</span> <span m="659000">On a chip that's about one square inch.</span> <span m="662000">You can put down 80 million gates.</span> <span m="664000">What is more important for today is what is on Page 2,</span> <span m="669000">actually. I have circled two things on</span> <span m="672000">Page 2. One thing that I have circled</span> <span m="675000">is power supply range in the 0.7 to 1.3 volts.</span> <span m="679000">Notice that that voltage, the power supply voltage for</span> <span m="683000">these chips is significantly lower than the 5 volts that we</span> <span m="688000">have been normally talking about in this course.</span> <span m="694000">When in doubt our problems have used 5 volts.</span> <span m="697000">But notice that in this technology they're talking about</span> <span m="702000">using voltages for the power supply VS in the range of 0.7 to</span> <span m="709000">Well, you will find out. The second thing I've circled</span> <span m="713000">is something called power dissipation.</span> <span m="717000">And you say power dissipation is said to be 0.006 microwatts</span> <span m="721000">per megahertz per gate. It says power dissipation is 6</span> <span m="727000">nanowatts per megahertz per gate.</span> <span m="729000">What that says is that each gate off your circuit will</span> <span m="733000">dissipate this much power at a 1 megahertz frequency.</span> <span m="737000">And the implication of that is that you should be able to</span> <span m="741000">convert that single number to the power dissipation in any</span> <span m="745000">chip that you might build depending on the number of gates</span> <span m="749000">that you have, the frequency you run the</span> <span m="752000">circuit at, the voltage that you use and so on and so forth.</span> <span m="758000">By the end of today's lecture you will be able to take this</span> <span m="761000">number and correlate that into the power dissipation of any</span> <span m="764000">chip that you might want to build with this.</span> <span m="767000">That just serves as the motivation that by the end of</span> <span m="769000">this lecture you will understand how to very quickly in five</span> <span m="773000">seconds or less, boom, given a chip,</span> <span m="775000">oh, yeah, that should consume about 30 watts of power.</span> <span m="779000">And what you will also do, based on some examples here,</span> <span m="782000">estimate the power of not the Pentium IV but a chip following</span> <span m="787000">the Pentium VI, let's call it the Pentium V</span> <span m="790000">would consume if it ran at 1 gigahertz.</span> <span m="793000">We will come up with some absolutely shocking numbers</span> <span m="797000">based on what you have learned. With that kind of motivation</span> <span m="801000">let me get into talking about some theory and get into the</span> <span m="805000">foundations of energy and power.</span> <span m="814000">Let's go to Page 3.</span> <span m="826000">To drive the theoretical discussion, I would like to</span> <span m="830000">focus on the energy dissipated in a MOSFET gate.</span> <span m="834000">And fundamentally we will talk about looking at energy and</span> <span m="839000">power in circuits containing switches, resistors and</span> <span m="843000">capacitors. The MOSFET gate is simply an</span> <span m="847000">illustrative example to drive the theory.</span> <span m="850000">But fundamentally what I am going to show you,</span> <span m="853000">or lead you through today, I will tell you how to compute</span> <span m="857000">the power and energy when you have capacitors,</span> <span m="861000">resistors, voltage sources and switches in your circuit.</span> <span m="865000">We will look at a circuit that looks like this.</span> <span m="868000">Your vanilla inverter circuit.</span> <span m="888000">My inverter. I apply some vIN signal here.</span> <span m="890000">It could be a square wave. It could be some sequence of</span> <span m="894000">ones and zeros. And this is an inverter that we</span> <span m="897000">all know and love. And this guy here is,</span> <span m="899000">stuck in a capacitor here. And this capacitor is meant to</span> <span m="904000">model the input gate capacitance of whatever this inverter drives</span> <span m="910000">plus any capacitance of the wire leading up to that gate and so</span> <span m="916000">on. It is just a lumped capacitor</span> <span m="919000">that I have stuck on there. I am interested in determining</span> <span m="924000">a few things. One is what we call the standby</span> <span m="928000">power. You will see all these terms</span> <span m="931000">being used in cell phones and so on.</span> <span m="933000">In your cell phone, your cell phone manufacturer</span> <span m="936000">gives you two numbers. Of course both are over</span> <span m="939000">exaggerations, but they give you two numbers</span> <span m="941000">nonetheless. One number is the number of</span> <span m="944000">days that the cell phone battery will last when in standby mode,</span> <span m="947000">right? That's exactly where standby</span> <span m="949000">comes from. In standby mode,</span> <span m="951000">how much power does your cell phone or how long will the</span> <span m="954000">battery last, that's the standby power.</span> <span m="958000">And the second thing is what we call active use power.</span> <span m="962000">Active use is when you are making a phone call and so on,</span> <span m="967000">what is the power consumed? And there again your</span> <span m="971000">manufacturer of your cell phone will give you a much smaller</span> <span m="977000">number for the active use power of your cell phone.</span> <span m="981000">What I am going to do is assume for discussion that the inverter</span> <span m="986000">is driven by a square wave signal of the following sort.</span> <span m="993000">This is vIN. And I am going to drive this</span> <span m="997000">with a signal of this sort. The period applied at the</span> <span m="1004000">input, so I am switching the inverter on and off,</span> <span m="1010000">on and off, on and off. And T1 seconds for the high,</span> <span m="1016000">T2 seconds for the low. This is the inverter,</span> <span m="1021000">this is the input signal, and we'll keep coming back to</span> <span m="1026000">that again and again. Rather than directly taking</span> <span m="1030000">this circuit and analyzing its power, I would like to do things</span> <span m="1036000">in a slightly roundabout manner. What I would like to do is show</span> <span m="1041000">you some very simple circuits and analyze their standby and</span> <span m="1046000">active powers. And then show you that this</span> <span m="1051000">circuit simply is a combination of some of the simple things</span> <span m="1057000">that you have seen. Example 1.</span> <span m="1059000">I would like to take a simple circuit that looks like this.</span> <span m="1065000">A voltage source V applied across a resistor R,</span> <span m="1069000">some current I. And if I apply a voltage across</span> <span m="1073000">this resistor, that voltage would simply</span> <span m="1077000">appear across the resistor. And the power is simply given</span> <span m="1083000">by VI which is simply V squared divided by R.</span> <span m="1087000">This is 6.002 101 in the very first chapter.</span> <span m="1091000">That is the power that is dissipated by this resistor,</span> <span m="1096000">simply V squared divided by R. That's the power dissipated by</span> <span m="1101000">the resistor. Where does that power come</span> <span m="1105000">from? The voltage source supplies the</span> <span m="1108000">power. So, this guy here supplies this</span> <span m="1113000">power and this guy here dissipates it.</span> <span m="1117000">What is the energy that I dissipate in T time?</span> <span m="1121000">Remember, power is the rate of energy dissipation.</span> <span m="1126000">And so energy is simply power multiplied by time.</span> <span m="1132000">For a circuit like this, energy dissipated in time T is</span> <span m="1137000">simply VIT. For our gate remember we have</span> <span m="1142000">two situations. We have VS, we have RL we have</span> <span m="1147000">RON, vO and vIN. So, vIN is high.</span> <span m="1150000">If vIN is high with respect to ground then RON,</span> <span m="1155000">the switch is on, and this is the circuit that I</span> <span m="1159000">see. In this situation the power</span> <span m="1162000">consumed is simply V squared divided by the resistance here.</span> <span m="1170000">It is simply VS squared divided by RL plus RON.</span> <span m="1178000">Let me mark that with an asterisk.</span> <span m="1185000">I will refer to this later. Similarly, when vIN is low the</span> <span m="1196000">MOSFET is off. And the power is simply zero.</span> <span m="1202000">I have no current flowing down and the power is zero.</span> <span m="1206000">Absolutely basic stuff. Absolutely basic.</span> <span m="1209000">So, the power, when I have the MOSFET on,</span> <span m="1212000">for the kind of inverters you have seen so far,</span> <span m="1215000">this is the power consumed by the inverter.</span> <span m="1219000">And this asterisk here is simply to say hold that thought,</span> <span m="1223000">we will get back to it a little later.</span> <span m="1226000">Let me work out a second example.</span> <span m="1230000">In this second example, I would like to consider the</span> <span m="1237000">following circuit, a voltage source VS with a</span> <span m="1244000">strange arrangement of switches, S1 with a resistance R1,</span> <span m="1252000">a capacitor C in this manner, a switch S2 and a resistor R2.</span> <span m="1262000">For now don't worry about how the circuit comes about.</span> <span m="1265000">Just assume that I have drawn the circuit for you.</span> <span m="1268000">And what I want to do is compute the power under certain</span> <span m="1272000">conditions. Notice that if this is off and</span> <span m="1274000">this is off, there is no current flowing either in this loop or</span> <span m="1278000">this loop, and the power dissipated by the circuit is</span> <span m="1282000">zero. But there are some arrangement</span> <span m="1284000">of switches for which I do consume power.</span> <span m="1288000">And so let me show you that arrangement of switches.</span> <span m="1293000">And what I am going to do is assume that the switches open</span> <span m="1299000">and close with the following periodic cycles.</span> <span m="1303000">Let's assume that when this is high S1 is closed and S2 is</span> <span m="1309000">open, and when this is low assume that S1 is open,</span> <span m="1315000">S2 is closed. And let's assume this is T,</span> <span m="1319000">this is T1, this is T2. That sequence should be</span> <span m="1324000">reminiscent of this input that I am feeding to this inverter.</span> <span m="1329000">All I am telling you here is that I am giving you the</span> <span m="1333000">circuit. I want to compute the power</span> <span m="1335000">consumption of the circuit. And what I am telling you is</span> <span m="1340000">that with the frequency, with a time period of capital</span> <span m="1344000">T, for the first T1 seconds this switch is closed and that is</span> <span m="1348000">open. So, this circuit applies.</span> <span m="1352000">In the second half of the clock this switch is open so this</span> <span m="1359000">circuit applies. And what I am interested in</span> <span m="1364000">finding out is what is the energy dissipated in each cycle</span> <span m="1371000">of time capital T? And I also want to find out the</span> <span m="1377000">average power. Just spend about five seconds</span> <span m="1382000">just staring at this and kind of intuit what is going on here.</span> <span m="1387000">I start by putting a voltage source here and I close the</span> <span m="1391000">switch. That is open.</span> <span m="1393000">Start by closing this, what happens?</span> <span m="1396000">When I close the switch VS is going to charge up this</span> <span m="1400000">capacitor. I get current flowing through</span> <span m="1403000">my resistor, so I am going to be charging up this capacitor here.</span> <span m="1410000">Then let's say I allow T1 to be as large as possible,</span> <span m="1413000">and so this capacitor is going to be charged up to all of VS.</span> <span m="1416000">After a long time this guy gets to be VS in the capacitor.</span> <span m="1420000">And as it is charging up I have current flow through the</span> <span m="1423000">resistor, so it is sitting there dissipating power.</span> <span m="1426000">Notice that this sucker does not dissipate energy.</span> <span m="1429000">It simply stores energy. So, the energy supplied by the</span> <span m="1432000">voltage source comes in, some of it gets stored in the</span> <span m="1435000">capacitor and some of it is being dissipated by the</span> <span m="1438000">resistor. That gets me to the end of T1.</span> <span m="1442000">At the end of T2 I open the switch and close this switch.</span> <span m="1446000">When I close the switch I have some energy on the capacitor,</span> <span m="1450000">and the voltage across the capacitor begins to drive a</span> <span m="1453000">current through this resistor R2.</span> <span m="1456000">And now the capacitor supplies its stored energy,</span> <span m="1459000">and its stored energy then begins to dissipate through</span> <span m="1463000">resistor R2. And if T2 is very long then all</span> <span m="1466000">the charge in the capacitor drains out.</span> <span m="1470000">And the voltage in the capacitor at the end will be</span> <span m="1475000">zero. So, that is just sort of a high</span> <span m="1478000">level description of what goes on.</span> <span m="1482000">Now let's go ahead and compute from first principles the</span> <span m="1487000">energetics of this little circuit.</span> <span m="1491000">Let's look at the entire period capital T, and as a first step</span> <span m="1497000">look at T1. When T1 is in place S1 is</span> <span m="1503000">closed and S2 is open. Accordingly,</span> <span m="1508000">the circuit that applies looks like this.</span> <span m="1513000">I have VS, S1 is closed, so that is closed,</span> <span m="1519000">and I have this resistance R1, I have this capacitance C,</span> <span m="1526000">some voltage VC across the capacitor.</span> <span m="1533000">You can go ahead and assume that VC of zero is zero.</span> <span m="1537000">That I start off my life with no voltage across the capacitor.</span> <span m="1543000">First of all, let me plot the waveforms and</span> <span m="1547000">write the expressions down and then compute the energy supplied</span> <span m="1553000">by the voltage source and then look at where the energy goes.</span> <span m="1560000">You all know, or should know by now,</span> <span m="1563000">if I plot VC as a function of time, remember,</span> <span m="1567000">this is really easy to do. VC as a function of time goes</span> <span m="1571000">like this. At time T equal to zero I am</span> <span m="1575000">telling you that the capacitor voltage is zero.</span> <span m="1579000">I am telling you that. So, it is at zero.</span> <span m="1583000">And then the capacitor charges up until it reaches VS.</span> <span m="1589000">I also know that after a long time this will be VS,</span> <span m="1593000">after a long time that will be VS, and between those two I have</span> <span m="1600000">a rising function that looks like this.</span> <span m="1603000">I can similarly plot the current for you.</span> <span m="1607000">At time T equal to zero instantaneously the capacitor</span> <span m="1612000">looks like a short, and so the current that I start</span> <span m="1617000">off with is going to be VS divided by R1.</span> <span m="1623000">The voltage across the capacitor is zero.</span> <span m="1626000">All the voltage falls across the resistor R1.</span> <span m="1629000">So, VS divided by R1 is the initial instantaneous current.</span> <span m="1634000">And after a long time, because VC reaches VS,</span> <span m="1637000">the current is going to be zero.</span> <span m="1640000">And between those two points I get an exponential decay.</span> <span m="1644000">I could very quickly write down the expression for the current.</span> <span m="1651000">And that is simply the initial value VS divided by R1 times the</span> <span m="1657000">exponential decay minus T divided by the time constant for</span> <span m="1663000">the circuit R1C. You have seen this stuff</span> <span m="1667000">before. Here comes the part that we</span> <span m="1670000">care about for now. Let's find out what is the</span> <span m="1675000">total energy provided by the source.</span> <span m="1680000">When dealing with energy computations you have to be</span> <span m="1685000">incredibly careful of these words here, supply,</span> <span m="1691000">provided versus dissipated. Dissipated implies that the</span> <span m="1697000">resistor is burning energy. Provided means that the source</span> <span m="1704000">is supplying that energy. So, energy provided by source</span> <span m="1710000">during T1. Let's go ahead and compute that</span> <span m="1715000">very quickly. The energy supplied by the</span> <span m="1718000">source is simply the voltage across the source multiplied by</span> <span m="1722000">the current being supplied by the source.</span> <span m="1725000">This is i. Remember, by associated</span> <span m="1728000">variables convention, if I have a voltage across some</span> <span m="1732000">element and the current into the element is positive then that</span> <span m="1737000">element dissipates power. If the voltage here is,</span> <span m="1742000">say, 1 volt and it is supplying current, if the i is out in the</span> <span m="1747000">other direction then it is supplying power.</span> <span m="1751000">In this case, the current i is going to be on</span> <span m="1755000">the outside, heading outside. The total energy is going to be</span> <span m="1761000">the instantaneous power integrated over time,</span> <span m="1765000">and that is simply VS. Remember, the instantaneous</span> <span m="1770000">power is VS times the current i, so the instantaneous power is</span> <span m="1775000">simply VS times i, that is the instantaneous</span> <span m="1778000">power. To get the energy provided by</span> <span m="1781000">source and some time, I have to integrate that</span> <span m="1784000">instantaneous power over the period of interest T1.</span> <span m="1788000">That gives me the energy supplied by the source during</span> <span m="1793000">T1. And let me go ahead and</span> <span m="1795000">substitute for i with this expression here.</span> <span m="1800000">It is VS times i, and i is VS divided by R1 times</span> <span m="1808000">this expression here. That gives me</span> <span m="1814000">(VS^2/R1)e^(-t/R1C) dt. Let me carry out the</span> <span m="1821000">integration there. I get -1/RC,</span> <span m="1826000">so I get this outside. And I also get to write down,</span> <span m="1835000">oops, let me do that a little bit more carefully.</span> <span m="1840000">VS^2/R1 simply comes out and I get a -R1C in the numerator.</span> <span m="1846000">If I differentiate it then I get R1C in the denominator.</span> <span m="1853000">I have an integral that comes up here.</span> <span m="1858000">And then I write down e^-t/R1C, zero and T1.</span> <span m="1863000">So, this R1 and this R1 cancel out.</span> <span m="1867000">And I end up getting something that looks like this.</span> <span m="1873000">I get CVS^2. And so there is a minus sign</span> <span m="1878000">out here, so at zero this thing goes to a one,</span> <span m="1883000">so I get a one. And because of minus sign I get</span> <span m="1889000">e to the -T1/R1C. All I have done here is simply</span> <span m="1895000">go through the math to do this integration here.</span> <span m="1900000">What I am also going to do is assume that if T1,</span> <span m="1905000">if the time that the switch is closed is much,</span> <span m="1909000">much bigger than the time constant of the circuit,</span> <span m="1914000">T1 is much, much greater than R1C, if this is much,</span> <span m="1919000">much greater than R1C then this term goes to zero.</span> <span m="1925000">And this becomes more or less equal to CVS^2.</span> <span m="1929000">What do we have here? What we have here is that if I</span> <span m="1935000">let the switch stay closed for a long time and S to be open then</span> <span m="1942000">the voltage source is going to supply some amount of energy.</span> <span m="1950000">That energy will equal CVS^2. The voltage across the</span> <span m="1954000">capacitor will be VS and all that energy would have been</span> <span m="1960000">supplied by this guy. Let me pose the following</span> <span m="1964000">conundrum here. If the voltage across the</span> <span m="1968000">capacitor is VS, because we know the energy</span> <span m="1972000">stored in the capacitor is half CV^2.</span> <span m="1976000">So, the energy in the capacitor is half CVS^2.</span> <span m="1982000">At the end of the day, since the voltage across the</span> <span m="1986000">capacitor is VS, ΩCV@2 is the energy stored</span> <span m="1990000">here. But we know,</span> <span m="1991000">from this calculation, the source has supplied CVS^2.</span> <span m="1996000">Source has supplied twice that energy.</span> <span m="1999000">This guy has supplied twice that energy and only half of</span> <span m="2004000">that is stored here. Who ate up the other half?</span> <span m="2010000">The resistor, exactly.</span> <span m="2012000">The resistor has walloped half the energy.</span> <span m="2016000">Let me just show it to you. It dissipated ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m="2021000">It's pretty interesting. It's a pretty simple result.</span> <span m="2027000">If T1 is very large compared to time constant then half the</span> <span m="2033000">energy is in the capacitor and half of it has been burned by</span> <span m="2039000">R1. This energy has not been</span> <span m="2043000">burned. It is simply stored.</span> <span m="2045000">It is stored by the capacitor.</span> <span m="2057000">And if you do simple energy conservation arithmetic here,</span> <span m="2061000">the energy dissipated in the resistor plus that stored in the</span> <span m="2065000">capacitor equals the energy supplied by the source.</span> <span m="2070000">All right. Let's go to T2 now.</span> <span m="2073000">At T2, S2 is closed and S1 is open.</span> <span m="2077000">Let's look at the second part of the cycle when S1 is open and</span> <span m="2084000">S2 is closed. And what is going to happen now</span> <span m="2089000">is the left-hand part of the circuit can be ignored and I can</span> <span m="2096000">focus on this part. So, S2 is closed.</span> <span m="2101000">This is RC, my capacitor, this is vC.</span> <span m="2105000">This is the circuit of interest.</span> <span m="2109000">What is the initial condition on this?</span> <span m="2112000">What is the value of vC initially?</span> <span m="2116000">Start off, because remember, I allowed this capacity to</span> <span m="2122000">charge up fully, and so initially I have VS on</span> <span m="2127000">the capacitor. And so the energy on the</span> <span m="2132000">capacitor initially is ΩCVS^2. That is the energy on the</span> <span m="2136000">capacitor. This time around I won't go</span> <span m="2139000">through an integration process like that, but you can if you</span> <span m="2144000">like, and do it in a much similar manner to say that now</span> <span m="2149000">let's suppose that T2 is much greater than this time constant.</span> <span m="2154000">If T2 is much greater than R2C, this time constant.</span> <span m="2160000">If that time is much greater than this entire,</span> <span m="2164000">the initial voltage VS drives a current through the resistor,</span> <span m="2171000">and after some amount of time the voltage across the capacitor</span> <span m="2177000">goes to zero and all the energy in the capacitor gets dissipated</span> <span m="2184000">in R. So, if T2 is much greater than</span> <span m="2188000">R2C then energy dissipated in R2 is simply ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m="2195000">Notice that the energy dissipated in R1,</span> <span m="2198000">in the first half cycle is ΩCVS^2 and the second half cycle</span> <span m="2203000">during T2, if T2 is large enough, all this energy gets</span> <span m="2208000">dissipated in this resistor R2. And I have that expression</span> <span m="2213000">here.</span> <span m="2220000">So let me just say that this is E1 and let me say that this is</span> <span m="2227000">E2. So, E1 is dissipated in the</span> <span m="2230000">resistor and E2 is dissipated in R2 in the second half cycle.</span> <span m="2237000">A couple of interesting things to note at this point.</span> <span m="2243000">One is that E1 and E2 are independent of R.</span> <span m="2250000">If the time constant is small enough compared to the time that</span> <span m="2253000">I charge the capacitor then half the energy gets lots in the</span> <span m="2257000">resistor, and that is simply ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m="2260000">And if I let this discharge completely it doesn't matter</span> <span m="2263000">what resistor I am discharging it through.</span> <span m="2266000">That's the intuition. If I have certain energy here</span> <span m="2269000">and I let it discharge completely it doesn't matter</span> <span m="2272000">what this resistor is. Small or large,</span> <span m="2275000">it doesn't matter. All this energy gets dissipated</span> <span m="2278000">there. The rate at which the energy</span> <span m="2282000">gets dissipated will change depending on R2.</span> <span m="2285000">If R2 is very small then I get a burst of power initially and</span> <span m="2289000">then a rapid decay after that, but if R2 is very large then I</span> <span m="2294000">have a much slower release of energy.</span> <span m="2296000">But suffice it to say that the energy dissipated,</span> <span m="2300000">the total energy in T2 is simply ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m="2303000">All right.</span> <span m="2312000">Let's put T1 and T2 together and look at the total energy</span> <span m="2317000">dissipated --</span> <span m="2328000">Total energy dissipated. E is simply E1 plus E2.</span> <span m="2335000">Dissipated in each cycle. Assuming T1 and T2 are much</span> <span m="2342000">larger than the respective time constants.</span> <span m="2346000">And I know that this is ΩCVS^2, ΩCVS^2, so this is simply</span> <span m="2351000">CVS^2. If I have an arrangement of</span> <span m="2354000">switches and capacitors like that, I charge the capacitor,</span> <span m="2359000">discharge the capacitor, charge the capacitor,</span> <span m="2363000">discharge the capacitor. What it is saying is that in a</span> <span m="2368000">charge/discharge cycle I am using up CVS^2 of energy.</span> <span m="2374000">ΩCVS^2 when I charge it up and ΩCVS^2 when I discharge it.</span> <span m="2380000">That is what I get. Let's compute the average power</span> <span m="2386000">dissipated, P average in a cycle is simply E/T where T is the</span> <span m="2394000">period of the square wave sequence that I have shown you</span> <span m="2400000">out there. This is simply CVS^2 divided by</span> <span m="2406000">T. If the period of the square</span> <span m="2409000">wave is capital T, I can express that as a</span> <span m="2414000">frequency. Let's say for example the</span> <span m="2418000">period of the square wave is T, so let's say the frequency of</span> <span m="2425000">the square wave is simply 1/T. I can also express this as</span> <span m="2433000">C(VS^2)f.</span> <span m="2443000">What does this say? Let me mark that as a thing to</span> <span m="2449000">remember, the second thing to remember.</span> <span m="2453000">One was the power that was the static power.</span> <span m="2460000">And second is this power relating to this frequency f and</span> <span m="2464000">the charging and discharging of the capacitor in that little</span> <span m="2468000">circuit shown up there. So, this average power is</span> <span m="2471000">CVS^2f. What this is saying is that if</span> <span m="2474000">f is high, if I have high frequency of charging and</span> <span m="2477000">discharging the capacitor then I am charging and discharging much</span> <span m="2482000">more frequently so I am going to consume more power.</span> <span m="2487000">Notice that at any given time there is no direct connection</span> <span m="2490000">between the power supply and the ground.</span> <span m="2493000">What I am doing is my capacitor is an intermediary.</span> <span m="2496000">I am dumping some charge in the capacitor and the capacitor is</span> <span m="2500000">dumping the charge into ground. It behaves like a switch to</span> <span m="2503000">capacitor. And what it is doing is it is</span> <span m="2506000">being charged and discharged at frequency f.</span> <span m="2509000">So, it makes sense that the amount of average current that I</span> <span m="2512000">am pumping through relates to the frequency at which I am</span> <span m="2516000">charging and discharging the capacitor.</span> <span m="2520000">And similarly the average power also relates to the value of the</span> <span m="2525000">capacitor. If C is larger I dissipate more</span> <span m="2529000">energy. And the same way with the</span> <span m="2532000">voltage. If the voltage is higher then</span> <span m="2535000">the power in that period, or the average power relates to</span> <span m="2540000">CVS^2. Spend a few seconds staring at</span> <span m="2544000">the two expressions. This power here relating to</span> <span m="2549000">just this connection between the power supply and ground and that</span> <span m="2554000">power out there relating to charging and discharging</span> <span m="2559000">capacitors. Let's get back to our inverter</span> <span m="2562000">right now.</span> <span m="2575000">This is our inverter circuit. Let us say that I drive the</span> <span m="2580000">input with the waveform shown here.</span> <span m="2583000">Well, I go back to the same situation as here.</span> <span m="2588000">I drive the input with a square wave, with T1 and T2 as the high</span> <span m="2594000">time and the low time. The equivalent circuit for this</span> <span m="2599000">is not exactly what we saw there.</span> <span m="2602000">The equivalent circuit for this would look like this.</span> <span m="2607000">I have a VS. And the VS supply is connected</span> <span m="2614000">through RL, VS connected through RL to a capacitor C.</span> <span m="2620000">This is my voltage vO. So, VS is always connected to</span> <span m="2627000">ground through this resistor and capacitor in this manner.</span> <span m="2635000">And then I have a resistor here RON corresponding to that</span> <span m="2642000">MOSFET. And there I am switching it on</span> <span m="2649000">and off in a way that it is on during T1 and off during T2.</span> <span m="2657000">So, the situation here is a bit different from that simple</span> <span m="2665000">situation I computed there. Much like I computed the power</span> <span m="2673000">dissipation in that circuit, I can go ahead and compute the</span> <span m="2679000">total power dissipated in this circuit.</span> <span m="2683000">I won't do it here. The algebra tends to be a big</span> <span m="2688000">more grubbier than what I have been through.</span> <span m="2693000">And suffice it to say that you can show that the average power</span> <span m="2699000">is given by (VS^2)/(2(RL+RON))+(CVS^2)f</span> <span m="2703000">(RL^2)/(RL+RON)^2.</span> <span m="2712000">OK? And for details I suggest that</span> <span m="2714000">you look at section 12.3 of the course notes.</span> <span m="2718000">Section 12.3 goes through the algebra to compute the total</span> <span m="2723000">power dissipated by this specific circuit,</span> <span m="2726000">and here is the expression we get.</span> <span m="2730000">And let's take the specific situation where RL is much</span> <span m="2737000">greater than RON. If RL is much greater than RON</span> <span m="2743000">then I can ignore this RON here.</span> <span m="2755000">And I get this. And out here,</span> <span m="2757000">if I ignore RON, then RL and RL will cancel out</span> <span m="2762000">and I get CVS^2f. If I ignore RON compared to RL</span> <span m="2767000">this is the expression I get. Now you can see why I went</span> <span m="2772000">through those two examples. This is exactly the power</span> <span m="2777000">consumed by the connection between power supply and ground.</span> <span m="2782000">And this CVS^2f is the power consumed in charging and</span> <span m="2786000">discharging the capacitor. If you look at the circuit here</span> <span m="2792000">it is consuming two kinds of power.</span> <span m="2795000">One kind of power is due to the current flowing directly from VS</span> <span m="2800000">through RL and RON to ground. Oh, this also assumes,</span> <span m="2804000">by the way, that T1 is equal to T2.</span> <span m="2815000">So, in this circuit there are two kinds of power.</span> <span m="2817000">One is the power when the switch is on and I have a</span> <span m="2819000">current flowing from VS to RL to ground.</span> <span m="2822000">Notice I get an extra factor of two in the denominator here.</span> <span m="2825000">And that two comes about because the connection to ground</span> <span m="2829000">only happens half the time. It's half that power out there</span> <span m="2833000">because I am connected to ground only when the switch is on.</span> <span m="2837000">And that happens only half the time, and so therefore I get the</span> <span m="2841000">VS^2/2RL. And then CVS^2f is simply the</span> <span m="2844000">power that I consumed because I am charging and discharging the</span> <span m="2848000">capacitor C. Notice that in this inverter</span> <span m="2851000">circuit there are two kinds of power.</span> <span m="2854000">One is called the standby power which is static power being</span> <span m="2858000">consumed by the circuit, and the second power is the</span> <span m="2861000">dynamic power because the circuit is switching up and</span> <span m="2864000">down. This relates to star and this</span> <span m="2867000">relates to the double star. And to demonstrate that,</span> <span m="2870000">I have a little demonstration here that has an inverter.</span> <span m="2873000">And I am going to up the frequency of the square way of</span> <span m="2877000">driving the inverter. I am going to show you a few</span> <span m="2881000">numbers so hang on for two minutes after this demo.</span> <span m="2884000">I will give you some numbers, but I want you to go ahead and</span> <span m="2888000">compute the numbers based on what we have seen here.</span> <span m="2891000">And you will get suitably impressed, I promise you.</span> <span m="2894000">This is the input fed to the inverter.</span> <span m="2896000">This is the output of the inverter.</span> <span m="2899000">Notice that the output of the inverter reflects some sort of</span> <span m="2902000">an RC time constant because of the output driving the</span> <span m="2905000">capacitor, and the same way here.</span> <span m="2909000">I start off by showing you that on the left-hand side I am</span> <span m="2913000">simply measuring the power being consumed by the circuit.</span> <span m="2918000">Notice that the power being consumed is expressed by the</span> <span m="2923000">needle being at this point here. This is a very low frequency so</span> <span m="2928000">this is almost all standby power consumed by the inverter.</span> <span m="2933000">The inverter is on half the time, and when it is on it is</span> <span m="2937000">consuming power. What I am going to now is</span> <span m="2941000">increase the frequency. As I increase the frequency</span> <span m="2944000">driving the inverter what should happen to this needle?</span> <span m="2947000">As I increase the frequency there that waveform should</span> <span m="2950000">become closer and closer together.</span> <span m="2952000">And what should happen to the needle?</span> <span m="2955000">That should begin to go up. If I increase the frequency it</span> <span m="2958000">should consume more and more power and the needle should</span> <span m="2961000">start going up. So, let me do that for you.</span> <span m="2964000">In terms of numbers there it is on top of the four on the scale</span> <span m="2968000">in the middle. I am going to increase the</span> <span m="2971000">frequency very slowly. Unfortunately,</span> <span m="2974000">the sampling scope messes up the waveform.</span> <span m="2977000">Ignore the waveform for now. Just look at the meter as I</span> <span m="2981000">increase the frequency.</span> <span m="2989000">Notice that I have increased the frequency by about a factor</span> <span m="2992000">of 2 or 3. And notice here that this meter</span> <span m="2994000">has moved. The needle has moved to the</span> <span m="2996000">right. And I can keep doing that and</span> <span m="2998000">the needle keeps moving to the right as I am consuming more and</span> <span m="3001000">more power because I'm driving the inverter faster and faster</span> <span m="3004000">and faster. That should convince you that</span> <span m="3007000">there is a standby power and there is some power component</span> <span m="3011000">related to frequency. This relates to your standby</span> <span m="3015000">power in your cell phone. This relates to active use.</span> <span m="3018000">Let me show you some numbers, and you can plug those numbers</span> <span m="3022000">in yourself and see how much power this converter is going to</span> <span m="3026000">consume and see if it makes sense.</span> <span m="3029000">Assume that I have a chip with 10^8 gates.</span> <span m="3033000">F is 1 gigahertz. That is 10^9.</span> <span m="3038000">Assume C is 0.1 femtofarads which is 10^-16 farads.</span> <span m="3047000">Assume VS is 5 volts. Assume RL is 10 kilo ohms.</span> <span m="3056000">Use these numbers. Plug these numbers in here and</span> <span m="3066000">get a sense if our modern-day circuitry used that inverter,</span> <span m="3076000">what would be the power consumed by a chip that contains</span> <span m="3086000">10^8 of these gates? You will find out that you may</span> <span m="3095000">have to use a nuclear power reactor to actually drive that</span> <span m="3105000">chip, but go check it out for yourselves.</span> <span m="3112000">In the next lecture we will see then how do our cell phones</span> <span m="3123000">work, how does life go on despite this horrendous</span> <span m="3131000">calculation here.</span> </p>

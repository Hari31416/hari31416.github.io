<p><span m="0">All right. Good morning,</span> <span m="3000">all. So we take another big step</span> <span m="8000">forward today and get onto a new plane of understanding,</span> <span m="16000">if you will. In the last week and a half,</span> <span m="23000">our focus was on the storage element or storage elements</span> <span m="31000">called inductors and capacitors. And capacitors stored change</span> <span m="40000">and inductors essentially stored energy in the field,</span> <span m="46000">the magnetic flux. And the state variable for an</span> <span m="51000">inductor was the current while that for a capacitor was the</span> <span m="57000">capacitor voltage. We also looked at circuits</span> <span m="62000">containing a single storage element, we looked at RC</span> <span m="66000">circuits and we also looked at circuits containing a single</span> <span m="71000">inductor. And this was a single inductor</span> <span m="74000">with a resistor and a current source or a voltage source and</span> <span m="79000">so on. What we are going to do today</span> <span m="82000">is do what are called "second-order systems".</span> </p>
<p><span m="96000">So they are on the next plane now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="98000">And with this second-order of systems, they are characterized</span> <span m="103000">by circuits containing two independent storage elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="107000">They could be an inductor and a capacitor or two independent</span> <span m="112000">capacitors. And you will see towards the</span> <span m="115000">end what I mean by two independent capacitors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120000">If I have two capacitors in parallel, they can be</span> <span m="123000">represented as a single equivalent capacitor so that</span> <span m="126000">doesn't count. It has to be two independent</span> <span m="128000">energy storage elements and resistors and voltage sources</span> <span m="132000">and so on. And what we end up getting is</span> <span m="134000">what is called "second-order dynamics".</span> </p>
<p><span m="137000">And much as first order circuits were represented using</span> <span m="140000">first order differential equations, this kind you end up</span> <span m="144000">getting second-order differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="148000">Before we go into this, I would like to start</span> <span m="151000">motivating this and give you one example of why this is important</span> <span m="156000">to study. There are many,</span> <span m="158000">many examples but I will give you one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="161000">What I would like to do is draw your attention to our good old</span> <span m="165000">inverter driving a second inverter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="168000">The same circuit that we used to motivate RC studies,</span> <span m="172000">one inverter driving another. So let me draw the circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="186000">Here is one inverter. This is, let's say,</span> <span m="190000">5 volts and this is, let's say, 2 kilo ohms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="195000">And I connect the output of this inverter to a second</span> <span m="201000">inverter. And what we saw in the last few</span> <span m="206000">lectures was that in this specific example there was a</span> <span m="212000">parasitic capacitor or a capacitor associated with the</span> <span m="218000">gate of this MOSFET. And that could be modeled by</span> <span m="224000">sticking a capacitor CGS between the gate of the MOSFET and</span> <span m="229000">ground. And we saw that the waveforms</span> <span m="233000">here, if I had some kind of step here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="237000">Let's say, for example, a step that went from high to</span> <span m="241000">low. Then out here I would have a</span> <span m="243000">transition that instead of going up rapidly like this would</span> <span m="248000">transition a little bit more slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="251000">And this transition was characterized by an RC time</span> <span m="255000">constant. And this is what gave rise to a</span> <span m="258000">delay in the eventual output. So that is what we saw</span> <span m="262000">previously, single energy storage element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="267000">Today what we are going to do is we are going to look at the</span> <span m="271000">same circuit, the exact same circuit,</span> <span m="274000">and have some fun with it. What we are going to say is</span> <span m="278000">look, this thing is pretty slow, so what I would like to do is</span> <span m="283000">-- why don't we go ahead and put that up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="295000">What we are going to see is that the yellow waveform is the</span> <span m="301000">waveform at the input here. And the green waveform here is</span> <span m="306000">the waveform at this intermediate node.</span> </p>
<p><span m="309000">And notice that this waveform here is characterized by the</span> <span m="313000">slowly rising characteristics that are typical of an RC</span> <span m="317000">circuit. There are some other</span> <span m="319000">weirdnesses and so on going on here like a little bump and</span> <span m="324000">stuff like that. You can ignore all of that for</span> <span m="327000">now. It happens because of certain</span> <span m="331000">other very subtle circuit effects that you won't be</span> <span m="335000">dealing with, called Miller effects and so on</span> <span m="338000">that you won't be dealing with in 6.002.</span> </p>
<p><span m="341000">So focus then on this part here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="343000">It is pretty slow. And because of that slow</span> <span m="346000">rising, I get a very slow transition and I get some delay</span> <span m="351000">in my inverter. So you say ah-ha,</span> <span m="353000">we learned about this in 6.002, I can make it go faster.</span> </p>
<p><span m="359000">How can you make the circuit go faster?</span> </p>
<p><span m="362000">What could you do? This is rising very slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366000">How can you make it go faster? Anybody?</span> </p>
<p><span m="369000">You have multiple choices, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="372000">What are your choices here? Pardon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="375000">Decrease the time constant. And how would you decrease the</span> <span m="380000">time constant? The capacitance is connected to</span> <span m="384000">this MOSFET gate here. I didn't want it in the first</span> <span m="390000">place but it is there, I cannot help it,</span> <span m="392000">so I can decrease the resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="395000">Good. Let me go ahead and do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="397000">What I will do is I am going to knock this sucker out and stick</span> <span m="402000">in a new resistance that is say 50 ohms, a much smaller</span> <span m="406000">resistance. That should speed things up,</span> <span m="409000">right? That should make things go much</span> <span m="411000">faster because this is a smaller time constant because R is</span> <span m="416000">smaller, correct? OK, let's go do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="420000">And let's see if we get what we expect.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423000">I have a little switch here. And using that switch,</span> <span m="427000">I am going to switch in this little resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431000">Whoa, what on earth is happening out there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="434000">This is so much fun. What I did is I switched in a</span> <span m="438000">small resister here to decrease the time constant,</span> <span m="442000">but it looks like I got a whole bunch of crapola that I did not</span> <span m="447000">bargain for. This is certainly very fast,</span> <span m="452000">it goes up really fast, but I am not sure where it is</span> <span m="456000">going, though. Let's stare at that a little</span> <span m="459000">while longer. Let me expand the time scale</span> <span m="462000">for you. Look at this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="464000">Instead of a nice little smooth thing going up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="467000">I get something that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470000">It looks something like a sinusoid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="473000">It looks sinusoidal, but then it is a sinusoid that</span> <span m="476000">kind of gives up and kind of gets tired and kind of goes</span> <span m="481000">away. Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="483000">It kind of dies out. So nothing that you have</span> <span m="487000">learned so far has prepared you for this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="491000">And, trust me, when I first did some circuit</span> <span m="495000">designs myself a long, long time ago I got nailed by</span> <span m="500000">that. I looked at my circuit,</span> <span m="502000">and what ended up happening was I was noticing these sharp lines</span> <span m="508000">at all my transitions. When I looked at my scope,</span> <span m="513000">I expected to see nice little square waves but I saw these</span> <span m="517000">little nasty spikes sitting out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="519000">And then when I stared at it more carefully,</span> <span m="522000">those spikes were really sinusoids that seemed to kind of</span> <span m="525000">get tired and kind of go away. So those are nasty,</span> <span m="528000">those are real and they happen all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="531000">And what we will do today is try to get into that and</span> <span m="534000">understand why that is the case. We will understand how to</span> <span m="537000">design that away. And that is a real problem,</span> <span m="542000">by the way. And the reason that is a real</span> <span m="545000">problem is the following. Look at this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="549000">Look down here. Because this intermediate</span> <span m="552000">voltage is meandering all over the countryside here,</span> <span m="556000">at this particular point the intermediate voltage dips quite</span> <span m="561000">low. And because it dips quite low</span> <span m="564000">look at the output. The output has a bump here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="570000">And it is quite possible for this output bump to now go into</span> <span m="573000">the forbidden region. Or worse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="575000">If this swing here was higher, this could have actually gone</span> <span m="579000">onto a one, so I would have gotten a false one pulse here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="583000">Instead of having a nice one to zero transition,</span> <span m="586000">I would have gotten a one to zero, oh, back to one,</span> <span m="589000">oh, back to zero and then back down to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="592000">So this is nasty stuff, really, really nasty stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="597000">What we will do is understand why that is the case today and</span> <span m="603000">see if we can explain it. What is going on here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="608000">What is really going on here is take a look at this circuit</span> <span m="614000">here. I will take a look at this path</span> <span m="618000">here. So this is your VS voltage</span> <span m="621000">source. Path kind of goes like this and</span> <span m="625000">around. It turns out that this circuit</span> <span m="630000">is a loop here. And when there is current flow,</span> <span m="634000">going down to basic physics you remember that I also enclose</span> <span m="638000">some amount. So there is a current flowing</span> <span m="642000">in a loop. And because of that there is an</span> <span m="645000">effective inductance here. And, in fact,</span> <span m="648000">any current flowing through a wire above a ground plane,</span> <span m="652000">for that matter, can be characterized by the</span> <span m="656000">inductance. So I can model that by sticking</span> <span m="659000">a little inductor here. So my real circuit is not</span> <span m="664000">exactly a resistor and a capacitor, but my real circuit</span> <span m="667000">is an inductor as well that comes into play because of this</span> <span m="671000">wire. Every wire, when there is a</span> <span m="673000">current flow, has an inductance associated</span> <span m="676000">with it. And because of that the real</span> <span m="678000">circuit is resistor, inductor and capacitor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="681000">So I end up with two storage elements now,</span> <span m="683000">and the dynamics of that are very different from that with a</span> <span m="687000">single storage element. That is just a bit of</span> <span m="692000">motivation for why our study of inductors is important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="697000">And I can draw a quick circuit here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="700000">If you look at the circuit, start from ground,</span> <span m="705000">the voltage VS and there is a resistor here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="709000">And then I have an inductor and then I have a capacitor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="714000">So it is a voltage source, resistor, inductor and</span> <span m="719000">capacitor. For this whole week we will be</span> <span m="724000">looking at circuits like this. Today what I would like to do</span> <span m="728000">is start very simple, start with the simplest</span> <span m="731000">possible form of this so that you can begin building up your</span> <span m="735000">insight and then go into more complicated cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738000">Today what I will do is simply begin with a case where I don't</span> <span m="742000">have a resistor here and simply study a voltage source,</span> <span m="746000">an inductor and a capacitor and understand what the voltage</span> <span m="750000">looks like out here. So we look at the dynamics of a</span> <span m="755000">little system like this. Before we go on,</span> <span m="759000">I want to caution you about something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762000">It is just happenstance that I have introduced for you</span> <span m="766000">capacitors based on the parasitic capacitance here and</span> <span m="771000">inductance based on parasitic inductance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774000">I would hate to leave you with the impression that inductors</span> <span m="779000">and capacitors are "bad". Because when you think of a</span> <span m="784000">parasitic, you know, parasites.</span> </p>
<p><span m="785000">These are parasitic. You didn't expect them there,</span> <span m="787000">didn't expect this here and we got the weird behavior.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790000">So parasitics have a bad connotation to them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="792000">I do not want to leave you with a bad taste in your mouth about</span> <span m="795000">capacitors and inductors that these are just bad things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797000">We just have to deal with them and deal with second-order</span> <span m="800000">differential equations and all that stuff because they're just</span> <span m="803000">bad stuff and we just have to deal with them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="805000">I don't want you to end up going through life hating</span> <span m="807000">capacitors and inductors. Just because of my choice of</span> <span m="811000">examples, it just happened to be introducing them as capacitors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815000">I want to point out that these are fundamental lumped elements</span> <span m="819000">in their own right. They are very,</span> <span m="821000">incredibly important and useful circuits where we designed</span> <span m="825000">capacitors and inductors because we want to have them in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829000">There are many circuits that we will look at where we really</span> <span m="833000">want the inductor in there. We will design an inductor by</span> <span m="836000">wrapping wire around in a coil and get bigger inductances and</span> <span m="840000">so. Just remember that this can be</span> <span m="844000">parasitic in some cases, but in many cases it's good,</span> <span m="848000">inductors are good, so just stick with that</span> <span m="852000">thought. These are mostly good so don't</span> <span m="855000">go around hating them. All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="857000">Let's go on and analyze a basic circuit like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="861000">And what I would like to cover in the next hour are the</span> <span m="866000">foundations of something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="870000">I will take you through the foundations so you understand</span> <span m="873000">how it works. And, as always,</span> <span m="875000">what I am going to end up with is build up the foundations,</span> <span m="879000">help you understand why we got where we were and then help you</span> <span m="882000">build intuition. And then show you a really,</span> <span m="885000">really simple intuitive way of doing things in terms of how</span> <span m="889000">experts do it. And the real cool thing about</span> <span m="892000">EECS is that the way experts do things, things are really,</span> <span m="895000">really very simple in the end. But you need to build up some</span> <span m="899000">intuition to get there. So our circuit looks like this</span> <span m="904000">in terms of my two storage elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907000">I have a voltage vI, inductor L, capacitor C and I</span> <span m="911000">am going to look at the voltage across the capacitor and my</span> <span m="916000">current through the capacitor. So v(t) is the voltage across</span> <span m="921000">the capacitor and my current is the current through this loop</span> <span m="926000">here, which is the same as the current through the capacitor or</span> <span m="931000">the current through the inductor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="935000">And we are going to proceed in exactly the same manner as we</span> <span m="938000">did for first order differential equations, write the equations</span> <span m="941000">down and just boom, boom, boom, boom,</span> <span m="943000">go down the same sets of steps but just get to some place</span> <span m="947000">different. We are going to start by</span> <span m="948000">writing a node equation for this node here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="951000">That's the only node for which I have an unknown voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="954000">The node here is vI, so I need to find this,</span> <span m="956000">there's just one unknown node voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="960000">And I am going to need some element laws.</span> </p>
<p><span m="964000">For the capacitor I know the iV relation is given by the i for</span> <span m="971000">the capacitor is Cdv/dt. And just to show the capacitor</span> <span m="977000">I am just calling it dvc/dt. Similarly, for an inductor,</span> <span m="983000">L, the voltage across the inductor is given by Ldi/dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="990000">So this is the vI relation for the capacitor,</span> <span m="994000">the vI relation for an inductor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="997000">It also suits us to write this in an integral form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1002000">So if I integrate both sides of this equation and I bring L down</span> <span m="1008000">to this side, I end up getting something like</span> <span m="1013000">this, 1/L minus infinity to t, VLdt, and that is simply iL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020000">I am just simply replacing this with an integral form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1024000">So this is a VI relationship for the inductor and this is for</span> <span m="1029000">the capacitor. So let me now go ahead and</span> <span m="1033000">apply the node method for my circuit here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1036000">Here, for the node method, I have to equate the currents</span> <span m="1041000">coming into the node or sum the currents coming into the node</span> <span m="1046000">and equate that to zero. And while I do that I simply</span> <span m="1052000">replace the currents by the corresponding voltages using the</span> <span m="1057000">element laws. So what do I get?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1060000">I get the current going in here to the inductor is equal to the</span> <span m="1065000">current going through the capacitor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1068000">What is the current going the capacitor?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1071000">In terms of its v relationship it is Cdv/dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1075000">And the current going to the inductor is given by this</span> <span m="1079000">relation here, which is simply 1/L minus</span> <span m="1083000">infinity to t. The voltage across the</span> <span m="1088000">capacitor is simply (vI-v)dt. I have just written down the</span> <span m="1094000">node quotation for this node here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1097000">Now I will just apply a bit of math and simplify it and get the</span> <span m="1103000">resulting equation. What I can do is simply</span> <span m="1108000">differentiate with respect to t here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1113000">And get this to be Cd^2v/dt^2, the second derivative of v.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1121000">And here what I end up getting is 1/L(vI-v).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127000">So I just differentiated the whole thing by d/dt here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1134000">And then I just move L up here. I bring d^2v/dt^2 out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1142000">And then I get a minus v here, and that will be equal to,</span> <span m="1148000">oh, I'm sorry. Let me leave this here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152000">Bring the minus v to this side so it becomes a plus and leave</span> <span m="1158000">vI on this side. So I end up getting</span> <span m="1162000">LCd^2v/dt^2. I bring L up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165000">And then I take v to the other side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1170000">Plus v and leave vI here so I get vI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173000">That is second order differential equation that</span> <span m="1177000">governs the characteristics of the voltage, v.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1180000">So much as the voltage across the capacitor was a state</span> <span m="1185000">variable in our RC circuits or the current through the inductor</span> <span m="1191000">was a state variable in our RL circuits, out here both the</span> <span m="1195000">current through the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor</span> <span m="1201000">are my two state variables. And so here I have a</span> <span m="1206000">second-order equation in my voltage, v.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209000">Again, going through the foundations here,</span> <span m="1212000">I am now going to go through a bunch of math.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1215000">Up to here it was circuit analysis, and now I am just</span> <span m="1218000">going to do math. For the next three or four</span> <span m="1222000">blackboards just math. You can solve this second-order</span> <span m="1225000">differential equation any which way you want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230000">But just to keep things as simple as possible,</span> <span m="1233000">in 6.002 I solve all the differential equations,</span> <span m="1236000">it turns out we are fortunate enough we can do that,</span> <span m="1240000">using the exact same method again and again and again,</span> <span m="1243000">the same thing can be applied. And the method that we use to</span> <span m="1248000">solve it is the method of homogenous and particular</span> <span m="1251000">solutions. So the first step we are going</span> <span m="1254000">to find the particular solution, vP.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1258000">Second step we find the homogenous solution,</span> <span m="1263000">vH. And the third step we are going</span> <span m="1267000">to find the total solution as the sum of, v is simply the</span> <span m="1274000">particular plus the homogenous solution and then solve for</span> <span m="1281000">constants based on the initial conditions and the applied</span> <span m="1287000">voltage. So let's write down initial</span> <span m="1292000">conditions. Let's assume,</span> <span m="1294000">for simplicity, that my initial conditions are</span> <span m="1297000">simply the voltage across the capacitor is zero to begin and</span> <span m="1302000">the current through my inductor is also zero as I begin life.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1307000">Now, this is what is called "zero state".</span> </p>
<p><span m="1311000">v and i are both zero, and so the response of my</span> <span m="1314000">circuit for some input is going to be called ZSR.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318000">You've probably heard this term in one of your recitations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1325000">So zero state response simply says I start with my circuit at</span> <span m="1330000">rest and looks at how it behaves for some given input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1334000">That is a little term you may end up using.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1338000">My input next. I am going to use the following</span> <span m="1342000">input. vI of t is going to be a step,</span> <span m="1345000">is going to look like this. My input is at t=0 v is going</span> <span m="1351000">from zero to some voltage VI and then stay at that voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355000">It is going to be a step. Kaboom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1357000">And you can see why I am going with this set of variables,</span> <span m="1361000">because I want make this situation as close as possible</span> <span m="1365000">to the funny behavior we observed there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1368000">Remember we had a step, and because of the step we had</span> <span m="1372000">some behavior at that node? So I will try to bring you as</span> <span m="1376000">close to that. In tomorrow's lecture,</span> <span m="1380000">I am going to close the loop around that and derive for you</span> <span m="1384000">exactly the behavior we saw on the scope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387000">And to get there I am going to be try to be as close as</span> <span m="1391000">possible to the constants and other parameters in the demo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395000">So VI is a step and zero state. Just in terms of notation,</span> <span m="1399000">this kind of a step input occurs pretty frequently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402000">And we just have a special notation for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1405000">We simply call it VI is the final value here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410000">And we call it u(t). So VIu(t), u(t) simply</span> <span m="1413000">represents a step at time t=0, steps from zero volts to VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419000">That is just a little more notation that will come in handy</span> <span m="1424000">at some point. More math now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1427000">Three steps, particular solution,</span> <span m="1430000">homogenous solution, total solution/constants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1434000">This is almost like a mantra here, like a chorus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1440000">Homogenous solution we compute using a four-step method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443000">And four-step method for homogenous solutions,</span> <span m="1446000">it turns out that it happens to be that way for all the</span> <span m="1449000">equations we will see in our course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452000">The first step would be assume a solution of the form Ae^st.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456000">Exactly as with RCs. If you close your eyes and do</span> <span m="1459000">exactly what you did for RCs you will get to where you want to</span> <span m="1463000">be. You assume a solution of the</span> <span m="1465000">form Ae^st. Substitute that into your</span> <span m="1467000">homogenous equation. Obtain the characteristic</span> <span m="1471000">equation. Solve for the roots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1474000">And then write down your homogenous solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1477000">Same sort of steps again and again and again until you get</span> <span m="1482000">bored to tears. Particular solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1485000">For the particular solution, I simply need to find a</span> <span m="1489000">solution, any solution, if not the most general one but</span> <span m="1493000">any solution that satisfies the particular equation which</span> <span m="1497000">satisfies that equation. LCd^2vP/dt^2+vP=VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1503000">My input is a step and I am going to look for the solution</span> <span m="1509000">for time t greater than zero. Notice that for time t less</span> <span m="1515000">than or equal to zero, v is going to be zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1520000">So I am looking for a solution greater than t=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526000">Here, if I substitute vP=VI, that is a particular solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1534000">Because if I substitute VI here this goes to zero and then I get</span> <span m="1539000">VI=VI, so this works. I promised you this was going</span> <span m="1543000">to be simple. You cannot get any simpler than</span> <span m="1547000">that. I have done my first step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549000">I found the particular solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1552000">And VI is a good enough particular solution so I will</span> <span m="1557000">use it, I will take it. As my second step I am going to</span> <span m="1563000">find vH or the solution to the homogenous equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1568000">And the homogenous equation is simply that equation with drive</span> <span m="1575000">set to zero. What I get here is</span> <span m="1578000">LCd^2vH/dt^2+vH=0. That is my homogenous equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1583000">I simply set the drive to be zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1588000">And to find the solution here, I go through my four-step</span> <span m="1592000">method. Again, in 6.002 following the</span> <span m="1594000">kind of Occam's principle, we just show you the absolute</span> <span m="1598000">minimum necessary to get to where you want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1601000">The absolute minimum necessary is it turns out that we can</span> <span m="1605000">solve all our differential equations that we use here by</span> <span m="1610000">using the methods of homogenous and particular solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1614000">And every homogenous solution can be solved by a four-step</span> <span m="1618000">method. That is about as minimal as it</span> <span m="1624000">can get. So no extraneous stuff there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629000">The four-step method, four steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1633000">The first step is assume a solution of the form vH=Ae^st.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641000">What I have noticed is that students starting out are</span> <span m="1648000">usually scared of differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1655000">I know I was when I was a student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1656000">And the trick with differential equations is that it is all a</span> <span m="1660000">matter of psych. Just because you see some</span> <span m="1662000">squigglies and squagglies and a bunch of math and so on you say</span> <span m="1666000">oh, that must be hard. But differential equations are</span> <span m="1669000">actually the simplest thing there is because in a large</span> <span m="1672000">majority of cases the way you solve them is you assume you</span> <span m="1675000">know the answer, someone tells you the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1679000">And then all you are left to do is shove the answer into the</span> <span m="1682000">equation and find out the constants that makes it the</span> <span m="1685000">answer. Just a matter of psych.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1687000">Psych yourselves that this stuff is easy,</span> <span m="1689000">because I am telling you what the solution is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1691000">All you have to do is substitute and verify.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694000">If you think about differential equations that way or a large</span> <span m="1697000">majority of them, it really is very simple if you</span> <span m="1700000">can just get past the squigglies here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702000">Just get past the squigglies and then just simply stick in</span> <span m="1706000">some simple stuff and it works. I mean it just cannot get any</span> <span m="1711000">easier. I cannot think of any other</span> <span m="1714000">field where the way you find a solution is assume you know the</span> <span m="1719000">solution and stick it in. It has never made any sense to</span> <span m="1723000">me but that is how it is. So we assume the solution to</span> <span m="1728000">the form Ae^st, you stick it in there,</span> <span m="1731000">and you have to find out the A and s that make it so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1735000">It cannot get any simpler than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1738000">Let's stick the sucker in here and see what we can get.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742000">Substitute Ae^st here I get LCA, and second derivative,</span> <span m="1747000">so it's s^2 e^st. And Ae^st on this one here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1752000">And that equals zero. And then let me just solve for</span> <span m="1757000">whatever I can find. Assuming I don't take the</span> <span m="1762000">trivial case A=0, I cancel these guys out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1766000">And what I am left with is simply LCs^2+1=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1772000">In other words, what I end up getting is B,</span> <span m="1776000">s^2=-1/LC. My first step was,</span> <span m="1778000">I am giving you solutions, stick them in there,</span> <span m="1783000">assume a solution of this form. Second step is get the</span> <span m="1788000">characteristic equation. And the way you get the</span> <span m="1793000">characteristic equation is that you simply stick this guy in</span> <span m="1799000">there. And what you end up getting is</span> <span m="1804000">some equation in s^2. Do you remember what you got</span> <span m="1809000">for first order circuits? What s was?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1813000">What is s? For first order circuits,</span> <span m="1817000">what did you get as a characteristic equation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1821000">s+1/RC=0. The same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824000">Just remember to blindly apply the steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1830000">It will lead you to the answer. This is called the</span> <span m="1833000">"characteristic equation". This is incredibly important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837000">You will see in about a couple weeks from now that once you</span> <span m="1841000">write the characteristic equation down for a circuit,</span> <span m="1844000">it tells you all there is to know about the circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1848000">And often times you can stop solving right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851000">To experienced circuit designers this tells me</span> <span m="1854000">everything there is to know. This is really key.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1859000">That's why it's called a characteristic equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1862000">I believe in problem number three of the homework that will</span> <span m="1865000">be coming out this week, that is exactly what you are</span> <span m="1869000">going to do. I am going to give you a</span> <span m="1871000">circuit, ask you to get to the characteristic equation quickly</span> <span m="1875000">and then from there intuit the solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1878000">Write the characteristic equation and then just intuit</span> <span m="1881000">solution, it's that simple. So, step A, assume a solution</span> <span m="1885000">of the form, step B, write the characteristic</span> <span m="1887000">equation down. And let me just simplify that a</span> <span m="1893000">little bit. I go ahead and find my roots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1897000">And my roots here, remember that j is the square</span> <span m="1902000">root of minus one. And so what I end up getting</span> <span m="1907000">is, my two roots here are, plus j square root of 1/LC and</span> <span m="1913000">minus j square root of 1/LC. Two roots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1919000">And just as a shorthand notation, much like I had a</span> <span m="1923000">shorthand notation for RC, what was my shorthand notation</span> <span m="1928000">for RC? Tau.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1929000">Just as tau was big in first order, we have a corresponding</span> <span m="1935000">thing that is big in second order and that is omega nought.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1940000">Omega nought is simply square root 1/LC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1944000">Just as tau was RC, omega nought is a shorthand</span> <span m="1948000">here. And so s is simply plus or</span> <span m="1953000">minus j omega nought. Notice that in this equation</span> <span m="1960000">here, if you take the square root of LC there that has units</span> <span m="1968000">of time, so one divided by that has units of frequency.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1976000">Notice that this guy is a frequency in radians.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1984000">I end up getting my roots of the homogenous equation,</span> <span m="1989000">and that is my third step. And as my fourth step,</span> <span m="1993000">I simply write down the homogenous solution as</span> <span m="1998000">substituting s with its roots and writing the most general</span> <span m="2003000">possible form of the solution, and that would be A1e^(j omega</span> <span m="2009000">nought t)+A2e^(-j omega nought t).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2014000">Done. Some constant times this</span> <span m="2016000">solution plus some other constant times,</span> <span m="2018000">the other solution. Plus zero omega nought.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2021000">Remember it comes from here, Ae^st.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2024000">I assume the solution of this form, so my solution in this</span> <span m="2028000">most general case would be s being j omega nought in one</span> <span m="2032000">case, minus j omega nought in the other case,</span> <span m="2035000">and I sum the two to get the most general solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2045000">So blasting ahead. I now have my homogenous</span> <span m="2050000">solution. And as my third step of</span> <span m="2054000">solution to differential equations I write down the total</span> <span m="2061000">solution, v=vP+vH, particular plus the homogenous</span> <span m="2067000">solutions. And v=VI, was my particular</span> <span m="2072000">solution, +A1e^(j omega nought t)+A2e^(-j omega nought t) is my</span> <span m="2078000">complete solution. The final step,</span> <span m="2081000">write down the total solution and find the constants from the</span> <span m="2086000">initial conditions. To find the constants from the</span> <span m="2091000">initial conditions, let's start with,</span> <span m="2094000">the voltage is zero to begin with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2099000">This equation governs the characteristics of v,</span> <span m="2103000">so I need to find the initial conditions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2108000">First of all, I know that know that v(0)=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2112000">From there I substitute t=0. And so this goes to one,</span> <span m="2117000">this goes to one, and I end up getting</span> <span m="2121000">0=VI+A1+A2. That is my first expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2125000">And then I am also given that i(0)=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131000">And so I can get that as well. How do I get i?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2137000">This is v. I know that i=Cdv/dt,</span> <span m="2141000">so I can get i by simply multiplying by C and</span> <span m="2147000">differentiating this with respect to t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2152000">I get C, this guy vanishes so I get d/dt of this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2160000">So it is CA1(j omega nought) e^(j omega nought t)+CA2(-j</span> <span m="2167000">omega nought)e^(-j omega nought t).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2172000">From here I am given that that is zero, and so therefore this</span> <span m="2181000">guy becomes a one, this guy becomes a one,</span> <span m="2186000">j omega nought, j omega nought cancel out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2194000">What I end up getting is A1=A2. From the second initial</span> <span m="2203000">condition I get A1=A2. From these two,</span> <span m="2210000">if I substitute here for A2, I get VI + 2A1 = 0,</span> <span m="2218000">or A1=-VI/2. That is also equal to A2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225000">Therefore, my total solution now can be written in terms of</span> <span m="2233000">the actual values of the constants I have obtained.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239000">I get VI-VI/2. So A1 and A2 are equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244000">I just pull them outside. I pull VI-2 outside and I stick</span> <span m="2253000">these two guys in parenthesis in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2258000">Again, I promised you no more circuits from here on until the</span> <span m="2266000">very last board or something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2272000">It is all math, so not much else happening</span> <span m="2277000">there. More math.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2281000">If you would like, I could skip all the way to the</span> <span m="2286000">end and show you the answer. But I just love to write</span> <span m="2293000">equations on the board so let me just go through that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2299000">I am going to simplify this a little further here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2305000">And we should remember this form by the Euler relation,</span> <span m="2311000">ejx=cos x+j sin x. And by the same token,</span> <span m="2318000">(e^jx + e^-jx)/2=cos x. You all should know this from</span> <span m="2327000">the Euler relation. So were are using this guy</span> <span m="2334000">here, ej^x + e^-jx=2cos x. And so this one is 2 cosine of</span> <span m="2344000">omega nought t, 2 and 2 cancel out,</span> <span m="2348000">and what I am left with is v(t)=VI-VI cos( omega nought t).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356000">And the current is Cdv/dt, which is simply CVI sin( omega</span> <span m="2364000">nought t). Just remember that omega nought</span> <span m="2370000">is the square root of 1/LC. We are done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376000">In fact, I did not give that answer the importance that was</span> <span m="2384000">due so let me just draw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2397000">There. That is better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400000">Enough math. In a nutshell,</span> <span m="2402000">what did we do. We wrote the node method,</span> <span m="2406000">it's a very simple circuit, to write down the equation</span> <span m="2410000">governing that circuit. And then we grunged through a</span> <span m="2415000">bunch of math. Not a whole lot here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2418000">It is pretty simple. And ended up with a relation</span> <span m="2423000">that says the voltage across the capacitor for a step input,</span> <span m="2428000">assuming zero state, is a constant VI-VI cos omega</span> <span m="2433000">t. Notice that even though I have</span> <span m="2436000">a step input, the circuit dynamics are such</span> <span m="2439000">that I get a cosine in there. You can begin to see where</span> <span m="2442000">these cosines are coming from now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2444000">They come in here. And if you recall the example I</span> <span m="2447000">showed you earlier of the inverter circuit,</span> <span m="2450000">remember there was a cosine that decayed,</span> <span m="2452000">that was sort of losing energy and kind of dying out?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2456000">So you can see where the cosines are coming from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2460000">And just to draw you a little sketch here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2471000">Let me draw v and i for you and let me plot omega t,</span> <span m="2486000">pi/2, pi and so on. Let me plot VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2495000">When time t=0, VI=0, cosine omega t is one,</span> <span m="2501000">and so VI-VI=0. That is simply a cosine that</span> <span m="2508000">starts out at zero here, and at pi I get cosine omega t</span> <span m="2516000">is minus one, so I get plus VI on the other</span> <span m="2522000">side. So I end up at +2VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528000">At this point the voltage is here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533000">And notice that this guy looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539000">It is a cosine that is translated up so that its mean</span> <span m="2547000">value is not zero but VI. It is just a translation up of</span> <span m="2557000">a cosine. Similarly, in this case for the</span> <span m="2562000">current it is a sinusoidal characteristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568000">And it looks something like this where the peak is given by</span> <span m="2576000">CVI, oh, I messed up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2588000">When I differentiated this is missed the omega nought out</span> <span m="2594000">there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605000">What I would like to do now -- This is the form of the output</span> <span m="2610000">for a step input. What I would like to do next is</span> <span m="2613000">show you a demo. But before I show you a demo,</span> <span m="2616000">I always found it strange that I have a step input and then I</span> <span m="2620000">have two little elements, how can I get a sine coming out</span> <span m="2624000">of the output? I would like to get some</span> <span m="2627000">intuition as to why things behave the way they are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630000">I could go and pray to find out, but let me just give you</span> <span m="2634000">some very basic insight as to why this behaves the way it</span> <span m="2638000">does. Let me draw the circuit for you</span> <span m="2642000">here. And this is my inductor L and</span> <span m="2645000">capacitance C. Remember this is v.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2648000">Let me just walk you through what is happening there and get</span> <span m="2653000">you to understand this. Now, you have seen sines occur</span> <span m="2657000">before. If you go and write down the</span> <span m="2660000">equation of motion of a pendulum, you know,</span> <span m="2664000">you have a pendulum, you move it to one side,</span> <span m="2668000">let go. It is also governed by</span> <span m="2671000">sinusoidal characteristics. And you will find that the</span> <span m="2675000">equation governing its motion is very much of the same form,</span> <span m="2679000">and you get the sinusoid where you have energy that is sloshing</span> <span m="2683000">back and forth between maximum potential energy to maximum</span> <span m="2687000">kinetic energy and zero potential energy back to maximum</span> <span m="2691000">potential energy, zero kinetic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693000">So it is energy sloshing back and forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696000">The same way here. Capacitors and inductors store</span> <span m="2701000">energy. Let's walk through and see what</span> <span m="2704000">happens. I start off with both of them</span> <span m="2706000">having the stage zero, zero current,</span> <span m="2709000">zero voltage. I apply a step here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2711000">Boom, the step comes instanteously to VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2714000">I notice that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantly</span> <span m="2718000">unless there is an infinite pulse of a sort,</span> <span m="2722000">so this guy cannot change instantly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724000">And so its voltage starts off being zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729000">So the entire voltage here, KVL must be true no matter</span> <span m="2732000">what. They are absolutely fundamental</span> <span m="2734000">principles from Maxwell's equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2736000">KVL must hold, which means that the entire</span> <span m="2738000">voltage VI must appear across the inductor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2740000">I put a big voltage across the inductor and its current begins</span> <span m="2744000">to build up. There you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2745000">A voltage across the inductor, its current begins to build up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2749000">As its current begins to build up that current must flow</span> <span m="2752000">through the capacitor, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754000">And as current flows through a capacitor it is depositing</span> <span m="2757000">charge into the capacitor. As the capacitor begins to get</span> <span m="2762000">charge deposited on it, its voltage begins to rise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767000">Let's see what happens here. Its voltage keeps rising.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2772000">At some point, the voltage across the</span> <span m="2776000">capacitor is equal to VI. But then VI equals this VI</span> <span m="2781000">here. So when the two become VI,</span> <span m="2784000">the inductor has zero volts across it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2789000">So there is no longer a potential difference that is</span> <span m="2792000">increasing the current in that direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795000">At that point, at pi divided by 2,</span> <span m="2797000">I have some current going into the inductor so there is no</span> <span m="2802000">longer a pressure that is forcing more current through the</span> <span m="2806000">inductor because this voltage reaches VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809000">But remember capacitors like to sit around holding voltages.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2813000">Just remember that demo. That rinky-dink capacitor sat</span> <span m="2817000">there stubbornly holding its voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2821000">And it had a huge spark towards the end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2823000">It just sat there holding its voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2825000">In the same manner, inductors love to sit around</span> <span m="2829000">holding a current. They will do whatever they can</span> <span m="2832000">to keep the current going through them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2834000">It has got the current going through.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837000">And few forces on earth can change that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2839000">And so therefore, even though the capacitor</span> <span m="2842000">voltage is VI and the voltage drop across the inductor is</span> <span m="2846000">zero, it still keeps supplying a current.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2850000">It has got the current. It's got inertia.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2852000">It keeps going. It is like a runaway train.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2854000">You may not be pushing the train from the back,</span> <span m="2857000">but once it is running it has got kinetic energy and is going</span> <span m="2861000">to run no matter what for a least some more time,</span> <span m="2863000">even if you take away the force on the train.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2866000">So I have taken away the force on the punching more current</span> <span m="2869000">through, but it has kinetic energy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872000">It has current flowing through it so it continues to supply a</span> <span m="2875000">current. Because it continues to supply</span> <span m="2877000">the current the capacitor voltage keeps increasing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2882000">This is a subtle insight which is absolutely spectacular that</span> <span m="2885000">with zero volts across it, it still keeps pumping that</span> <span m="2889000">current. Capacitor voltage has gone up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2891000">And guess what? The voltage on this side is</span> <span m="2894000">higher now but this guy is still pumping a current.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2897000">Man, I have been born to do this, you know,</span> <span m="2900000">I shall pump a current. However, because the voltage</span> <span m="2904000">has now gone up here gradually the current begins to diminish.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2909000">So the capacitor is concerned. You pump a current into me,</span> <span m="2913000">my voltage goes up. At some point,</span> <span m="2916000">like a runaway train, it comes to a halt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2919000">The current through the capacitor drains and now goes to</span> <span m="2924000">zero and the capacitor voltage reaches 2VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2927000">So this is at 2VI now and this is at VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2930000">Now the situation is not in equilibrium.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2933000">At this point there is zero current through it,</span> <span m="2937000">but guess what? I have a VI pumping in this</span> <span m="2941000">direction now. I have the same VI punching in</span> <span m="2945000">this direction. So guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2947000">Its current must now build up in this direction and its</span> <span m="2951000">current begins to build up in that direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2954000">That begins to discharge the capacitor and the capacitor then</span> <span m="2958000">goes on to a negative, or the current goes down to a</span> <span m="2962000">maximum negative current, and this process continues.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2966000">What you are seeing here is energy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2970000">It is sloshing back and forth between the two,</span> <span m="2973000">and that is kind of a key. I will just quickly put up a</span> <span m="2977000">demo that you can watch as you are walking out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2980000">With a step input, notice the green is the voltage</span> <span m="2984000">across the capacitor and the orange is the current through</span> <span m="2988000">the capacitor.</span> </p>

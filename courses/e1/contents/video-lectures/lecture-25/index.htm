<p><span m="0">All right. Good morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000">Good morning. So, we have some fun stuff for</span> <span m="8000">today's lecture, and as far as the final is</span> <span m="13000">concerned and so on, I'd like you to forget about</span> <span m="19000">anything we do today, absolutely.</span> </p>
<p><span m="23000">So, get your mind to become a blank, and forget anything you</span> <span m="31000">hear in today's lecture. So, what I'm going to show you</span> <span m="38000">today will hopefully completely blow your minds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="42000">And I'm not talking about controlled substances or</span> <span m="46000">anything. So what I'm going to do is show</span> <span m="49000">you a few things that behave completely and spectacularly</span> <span m="54000">differently than how you expect them to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="58000">And, today's lecture is appropriately called --</span> <span m="77000">OK. So, we're going to violate the</span> <span m="79000">abstraction barrier here, and do some fun things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="82000">And, the important thing to realize is that in all of 6.002,</span> <span m="86000">we have, after all, based on some assumptions we</span> <span m="89000">made at the beginning of the course like lumped matter</span> <span m="93000">discipline and so on, we have landed ourselves in</span> <span m="96000">this playground called the playground of 6.002.</span> </p>
<p><span m="101000">And, within that playground, certain ground rules apply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="104000">OK, and our entire course depended on those assumptions</span> <span m="107000">being true. So, for example,</span> <span m="109000">the first assumption we made that brought us from Maxwell's</span> <span m="113000">equations to the lumped matter discipline was,</span> <span m="116000">or rather the circuit abstraction, was a lumped matter</span> <span m="119000">discipline. And there were three tenets of</span> <span m="123000">the lumped matter discipline. One is that the rate of change</span> <span m="126000">of flux was going to be zero within our circuits,</span> <span m="130000">not inside elements, but in the circuit itself,</span> <span m="133000">and second, the dq by dt was going to be zero outside the</span> <span m="137000">elements, and third, something we did not dwell upon</span> <span m="140000">in the course, but it's certainly present in</span> <span m="143000">the course notes is that the speeds of signals that we are</span> <span m="147000">going to consider are going to be much slower than the speed of</span> <span m="151000">light. OK, so we're going to be</span> <span m="156000">working in a realm where we are going to be well slower than the</span> <span m="165000">speed of light. OK, so starting with that,</span> <span m="170000">let me walk you through some examples and some fun stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="178000">So, the first case is called the Double Take.</span> </p>
<p><span m="186000">So, let me sketch out a small little circuit for you,</span> <span m="191000">and take a look at the expected behavior, and then show you what</span> <span m="197000">really happens in real life. So, the first case,</span> <span m="202000">I have a voltage source, and what I'm going to do is</span> <span m="208000">make a transition from a zero to a one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="213000">Think of it as a step input, and through a Thevenin like</span> <span m="219000">resistance, I want to feed it to a circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="225000">The circuit will go to an inverter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="229000">This node goes to an inverter, and goes through some other</span> <span m="236000">circuits within our own design here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="242000">So, again, remember, a step input here,</span> <span m="245000">and this input goes through a Thevenin like resistance,</span> <span m="251000">or is applied to some other circuit elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="255000">So, if I apply a step here, what do you expect?</span> </p>
<p><span m="260000">You expect that, so let me call that VI,</span> <span m="264000">and let me call that Vo. So, if I plot VI as a function</span> <span m="269000">of time, and let's say this step input happens at t=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="276000">So let's say this is t=0 here, and let's say this is a 5V</span> <span m="284000">step. So, I expect that this input</span> <span m="289000">here is going to go to, VI here, is going to go to 5V</span> <span m="297000">at t=0. What do I expect at Vo?</span> </p>
<p><span m="303000">At Vo, based on our circuit abstraction, I get a step input</span> <span m="307000">here. I should get a step of some</span> <span m="309000">magnitude here, depending on what's connected</span> <span m="312000">in this direction. And let's simply say that</span> <span m="316000">what's connected here is an inverter, and maybe other</span> <span m="319000">inverters at the other side. So essentially,</span> <span m="323000">as far as this node is concerned, it's got some wires</span> <span m="326000">connected to it. And at the end of the wires,</span> <span m="330000">it has an open circuit, an open circuit,</span> <span m="332000">for example, like the gate input of this</span> <span m="335000">inverter. So what do you expect at V</span> <span m="341000">nought? A step input here,</span> <span m="344000">and at V nought I see an open circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="349000">OK, so I expect the same step at V nought: 5V.</span> </p>
<p><span m="354000">So, that's what we've prepared you for, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="361000">But, the fun thing that we're going to see,</span> <span m="364000">so this is what you expect, and I'll show you a little demo</span> <span m="369000">that is going to show you something very different.</span> </p>
<p><span m="373000">What you're going to see is not this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="376000">OK, you're not going to be seeing that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="379000">Rather, I'm going to show you something that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="396000">So, at t=0, I do see Vo looking like a step, and approximately</span> <span m="400000">halfway through, decides, ah,</span> <span m="403000">well never mind, and flattens out,</span> <span m="405000">OK, then says, oh, OK, and zoom,</span> <span m="408000">it goes back up to 5V. So, it sort of does a bit of a</span> <span m="412000">double take up there saying, hey, what's going on here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="417000">And zoom, jumps up to 5V, and then it's five as you</span> <span m="421000">expect. OK, so this is some finite</span> <span m="425000">amount of time that looks like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="429000">OK, so try to understand what's going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="434000">So let me show you a quick little demo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="438000">So that's the input VI. OK, so that's the input VI that</span> <span m="444000">you expect, and I won't do anything to my circuit at this</span> <span m="450000">point. And, go ahead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="454000">So, let's see what happens now. There you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="457000">So now, I'm showing you the output here at Vo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="461000">So at VI, there's a nice little step, and at Vo,</span> <span m="464000">notice that I get something that behaves like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="468000">OK, and I promise you, nothing we've taught you in</span> <span m="472000">6.002 prepares you for this. OK, and as I mentioned at the</span> <span m="477000">beginning of this lecture, it would behoove you to forget</span> <span m="481000">about everything you learn in today's lecture for the next two</span> <span m="486000">weeks at least. So what's going on here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="491000">Any ideas? Anybody?</span> </p>
<p><span m="492000">Any thoughts? So what's up with my circuit</span> <span m="496000">here? It says, oh,</span> <span m="497000">OK, a step. It starts off and says,</span> <span m="500000">oh, never mind, and then meanders along at 2.5V</span> <span m="504000">and then says oh, step, yes, I remember,</span> <span m="508000">and then boom, it jumps up to 5V.</span> </p>
<p><span m="512000">So, any theories? Any guesses?</span> </p>
<p><span m="515000">Any wild guesses? OK, so let me draw you a little</span> <span m="520000">bit more of a detailed circuit, and see if you can explain</span> <span m="526000">what's going on here. So, the circuit that I've drawn</span> <span m="532000">there is not quite the circuit I have at least in terms of my</span> <span m="538000">wires. So, what I have is something</span> <span m="542000">that looks like this, VI, and this is going to step</span> <span m="547000">to 5V. I do have a resistance,</span> <span m="553000">R. This is Vo, this does go to an</span> <span m="558000">inverter. But what is also happening is</span> <span m="564000">that I have a long wire. OK, you see this guy here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="574000">We had one of our union folks stretch out along the floor</span> <span m="579000">here. We have a really long wire that</span> <span m="582000">connects to the Vo node, and there's also a long</span> <span m="586000">corresponding ground. So, this wire is a coaxial</span> <span m="591000">cable that is used for Ethernet and such like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="595000">It's got a core that carries a signal, and around the core is</span> <span m="601000">shielding that is the ground. OK, so that goes a long way,</span> <span m="607000">and at the end, it is open.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610000">OK, it's an open circuit at the end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="614000">I haven't connected anything out there: open circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="619000">So, you know, something's happening here</span> <span m="623000">that's making the circuit behave like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="628000">So, this is VI. At Vo --</span> <span m="648000">So at Vo I'm getting this funny behavior.</span> </p>
<p><span m="651000">OK, so does anybody want to take the next piece of clues</span> <span m="655000">here, does anybody want to take a stab at guessing what might be</span> <span m="660000">going on here? Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="662000">Ah, we have a shill in the audience here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="666000">So, the theory is that the step here, think of it as an</span> <span m="671000">electromagnetic pulse that goes from zero to five,</span> <span m="676000">and things in real life don't travel instantaneously.</span> </p>
<p><span m="681000">So, there's something with a wave that flies down,</span> <span m="686000">and the wave goes to the end, flips, and then comes back,</span> <span m="692000">and then establishes the full voltage here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="698000">So that is indeed at the root of what's going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="701000">And let me put it in layman's terms and then describe the</span> <span m="706000">details of what's going on here. OK, so the way to view what's</span> <span m="711000">going on is that I have this long wire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="714000">OK, in the very first lecture, I started off by saying wires</span> <span m="719000">are ideal. OK, ideal wires are such that I</span> <span m="723000">can transmit signals on them. Wires are small so that the</span> <span m="726000">propagation time of signals is inconsequential compared to the</span> <span m="731000">rise times and fall times of the signals of interest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="734000">By having this really long cable here, I have clearly</span> <span m="738000">violated that assumption, which is the wires are really,</span> <span m="741000">really long here. OK, and so I somehow need to</span> <span m="745000">model what the wire is doing to my circuit when I don't have a</span> <span m="749000">small wire. So what actually happens,</span> <span m="753000">the way to view it is the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757000">So, although this is a wire, to understand the mechanics of</span> <span m="762000">what's going on, I really have to model it much</span> <span m="767000">more accurately, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="769000">And, the way to model a wire like this is that notice that</span> <span m="775000">every small element of a wire has associated with it some</span> <span m="780000">inductance. OK, so let's take a small</span> <span m="784000">segment of the coax cable here. The coax cable is a small core</span> <span m="789000">surrounded by a metallic shield. OK, that's a ground.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794000">And so, when I have a wire surrounded by a metallic shield,</span> <span m="798000">that also has the capacitance, OK, inductance and capacitance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="803000">So this small segment can be modeled as a really small</span> <span m="807000">inductance, and a really tiny capacitance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="812000">Similarly, the next segment can be modeled as a tiny inductance</span> <span m="816000">and a capacitance. There is also a resistance</span> <span m="820000">here, but let's assume that the resistance is zero for our</span> <span m="824000">model, and also the parallel resistance is also infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829000">OK, so it's an inductor, capacitor, and really the</span> <span m="832000">situation that I have is not a pair of ideal wires,</span> <span m="836000">but really a really, really small inductance,</span> <span m="840000">and a small capacitance in parallel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844000">So, it's more of a set of distributed elements that I have</span> <span m="848000">here. Notice that in my lump circuit</span> <span m="851000">abstraction, when we talked about the RLC model for the wire</span> <span m="855000">between two inverters, we lumped it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="858000">We lumped this thing into a model that looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862000">OK, we lumped the resistance into a source resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="867000">We lumped all the inductors into a lumped inductor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="872000">We lumped all the capacitances into a lumped capacitance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="876000">OK, but in this situation, I can do this when the signal</span> <span m="880000">speeds of interest are much, much, much slower than the</span> <span m="884000">speed of light than the propagation speeds of</span> <span m="888000">electromagnetic signals. In this case,</span> <span m="890000">that is not quite true. And so, therefore,</span> <span m="894000">we have to model it much more exactly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="896000">We need to see what's going on. So, what's happening here is</span> <span m="901000">that at t=0, I get this step. So, think of that as a pulse of</span> <span m="907000">energy, and the instant it comes here, and instantaneously this</span> <span m="911000">guy looks like a voltage divider, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="914000">I've chosen my resistance, R, here to match the</span> <span m="918000">instantaneous impedance looking in, which is also R.</span> </p>
<p><span m="921000">I've arranged it to be that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="924000">So, instantaneously, the point at which the pulse</span> <span m="927000">appears at this point, looking down here looks like</span> <span m="931000">another resistor to this pulse. OK, therefore,</span> <span m="935000">when I start out, I start out going up and</span> <span m="938000">pausing at 2.5 because instantaneously,</span> <span m="941000">this looks like a resistance, R.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943000">So instantaneously, it's a voltage divider,</span> <span m="946000">R, and so it's 2.5 here, instantaneously.</span> </p>
<p><span m="949000">OK, then what happens? Then those little pulse</span> <span m="952000">propagates down. What does it mean for a pulse</span> <span m="955000">of energy to propagate down? Well, it begins sending a</span> <span m="958000">current through the inductor, begins charging up the</span> <span m="962000">capacitor, current here, so that's what I mean by saying</span> <span m="966000">that the pulse of energy goes down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970000">OK, it's a step that sends current to the inductor and</span> <span m="974000">charges of the capacitors, and that wave front moves out</span> <span m="979000">here and comes all the way here. What happens there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="983000">Well, think about it. Supposing you stand here,</span> <span m="987000">and you hold a long string in your hand somehow,</span> <span m="991000">and just do this Gedanken experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="995000">It's not easy to do. And so, let's say you somehow</span> <span m="998000">have the long string that you're holding onto,</span> <span m="1001000">and the string on the other side is not connected to</span> <span m="1005000">anything. OK, just imagine this</span> <span m="1007000">experiment. OK, and what you do is you</span> <span m="1010000">suddenly raise the string up at your end by about a foot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1014000">What are you going to see happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016000">So instantaneously, the string is up here,</span> <span m="1019000">but the rest of the string is down a foot below.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1024000">And then you see this wave propagate down the string,</span> <span m="1027000">right? So here's a string.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1029000">I lift this thing, and you see this wave propagate</span> <span m="1032000">all the way down, the one foot wave propagate all</span> <span m="1035000">the way down until you come here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037000">What happens here? So, out here,</span> <span m="1040000">the string is down here, the wave propagates out here</span> <span m="1043000">and pulls it up to one. And then what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1046000">There's nothing connected there, so the string is zipped</span> <span m="1049000">up, but it's got the energy. OK, where does energy go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1054000">Well, it continues going up, and sends a wave back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1057000">OK, so just think of a string that you pull up like this and</span> <span m="1060000">propagates down, boom, hits the other end,</span> <span m="1063000">reverses, and comes back at me. OK, you can look at a</span> <span m="1066000">complementary situation, not the same as this,</span> <span m="1068000">but complementary by taking a string, tying it to a door,</span> <span m="1071000">and lifting it up. It's not the same situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1074000">It's a complementary situation where it's tied down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077000">Tying down a string is tantamount to shorting the ends</span> <span m="1080000">here. OK, in that case what you'll</span> <span m="1083000">see happen: as the wave goes down, at the end the string</span> <span m="1087000">can't move, so the wave goes and flips around and comes back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1091000">Try it out at home. Take a long piece of string,</span> <span m="1093000">tie it up there, do this, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1095000">And you'll see the wave go out, flip, and then come back at</span> <span m="1099000">you. So, if your friends see you</span> <span m="1101000">tying a long piece of string doing this, hopefully they won't</span> <span m="1105000">think you're nuts or something. OK, so the same way here:</span> <span m="1109000">this thing flies down, OK, there's no way to dissipate</span> <span m="1113000">the energy here, so this thing continues up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1115000">And then, what I'm going to see happen is the wave move back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1119000">OK, the wave begins to move back, and that's another 2.5V,</span> <span m="1123000">resulting in a net 5V at this terminal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1126000">That wave begins to blast back, OK, and then when it comes back</span> <span m="1130000">here, after some amount of time, it raises this to 5V,</span> <span m="1133000">and that's what you see happen here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136000">So, this is a wave going down, and then after a time,</span> <span m="1139000">2t, it goes back up to 5V. That's a return wave.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1144000">It's 2t because to get down here is t seconds,</span> <span m="1147000">and then t seconds to come back, which is why we have 2t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152000">OK, that is why you see that pulse at 2.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1155000">OK, so I'd like to show you a few more things here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159000">Clearly we don't want that in our circuits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162000">Could someone tell me what problem would happen if my</span> <span m="1167000">signals looked like this in my digital circuits?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1172000">Instead of being nice little steps, if there was a little</span> <span m="1179000">thing in the middle and then a step, what's the problem with</span> <span m="1186000">signals like this? In digital circuits,</span> <span m="1191000">what did it violate? Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1194000">Exactly. This little sucker here is</span> <span m="1199000">meandering out in the forbidden region for all of 2T.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1205000">Can't do that. OK, can't have that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1210000">Well, so we need to fix the problem because this is real</span> <span m="1217000">life. OK, but what if you and your</span> <span m="1220000">buddy were signaling each other but using digital signals from</span> <span m="1223000">one dorm room to another maybe a few hundred feet down?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1224000">Your circuit isn't going to work because the signal's going</span> <span m="1226000">to meander around in the forbidden region for some time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1228000">So, any ideas what might you do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1229000">Yeah? Put a resistor on the end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230000">OK, trick the circuit. So, what you can do,</span> <span m="1232000">and I'm going to show you a little demo here,</span> <span m="1233000">what you can do is the reason I got this wave propagating back,</span> <span m="1235000">was that there was nothing to absorb the energy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1238000">So instead, what if I put another resistor here,</span> <span m="1241000">R? So, as far as a burst of energy</span> <span m="1244000">is concerned, it says, oh,</span> <span m="1246000">yeah, it just looks the same. It's R, and goes and dissipates</span> <span m="1250000">in this resistor, R, and guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1253000">I don't have any wave going back, and I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1256000">So, what I'm going to find, then, is that out here,</span> <span m="1260000">this goes up to 5V, but out here,</span> <span m="1263000">I will have a signal that starts out and goes up to 2.5,</span> <span m="1267000">and that's it. OK, I lift it up,</span> <span m="1271000">it goes down, it goes to 2.5 because in the</span> <span m="1274000">lumped model that you've been dealing with,</span> <span m="1277000">it's a resistor R, a resistor R to ground,</span> <span m="1280000">and you're taking the connection here or here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1283000">So, it's your standard lumped model, your voltage resistive</span> <span m="1287000">divider, and it just simply works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1289000">Yeah, that's it. So, this is the end of the</span> <span m="1294000">cable. OK, if somehow you could watch</span> <span m="1297000">this and that at the same time, so what I'm going to do,</span> <span m="1303000">and this is a resistor, R, I'm just going to plug it</span> <span m="1307000">in. OK, if the fates are smiling at</span> <span m="1311000">me, what should you see there? What should happen is that the</span> <span m="1316000">second jump from 2.5 to 5 should simply go away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1321000">It should just go to 2.5. Let's try that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1326000">There you go. I take it out,</span> <span m="1330000">it jumps back up. OK, so all I've done here is</span> <span m="1336000">put in a resistor at the end, and I'm still measuring the</span> <span m="1344000">voltage here. So, that's one solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1350000">One solution is to put a resistor here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1352000">So, I absorb the energy, and the resistance has to be</span> <span m="1356000">equal to the instantaneous impedance looking in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1359000">And the instantaneous impedance, for many of these</span> <span m="1362000">cables is 50 ohms. It's called a characteristic</span> <span m="1365000">impedance. OK, you'll learn a lot more</span> <span m="1367000">about it if you take 6.014. That course starts out with</span> <span m="1371000">assuming that things are distributed in that matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1376000">OK, so if you want to design multi-gigahertz chips,</span> <span m="1379000">it turns out that if you have signals that are traveling</span> <span m="1384000">around at edge speeds in the 0.1-1 nanosecond range,</span> <span m="1388000">remember, light travels roughly one nanosecond a foot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1392000">And if the signals are roughly of interest are 0.1 nanoseconds,</span> <span m="1396000">then if the chips are one inch in size, right there,</span> <span m="1400000">the propagation speed of a signal across a chip is 0.1</span> <span m="1404000">nanoseconds. OK, so today,</span> <span m="1406000">we have to deal with these issues and try to figure out</span> <span m="1410000">what to do about them. OK, so that's one solution that</span> <span m="1416000">somebody pointed out. There is a second solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420000">Anybody else have a second solution for me?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1423000">And then there's a third solution, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1426000">So it's OK. You can give me either the</span> <span m="1429000">second or the third solution. It doesn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1433000">Anybody? You have two to choose from,</span> <span m="1436000">come on. Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1437000">You can do that, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1440000">So we could define the problem away by saying this transition</span> <span m="1445000">is such that my high is below</span> <span m="1447000">So, once it goes above 2.5, who cares what it does?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452000">That's a good point. That's solution number four,</span> <span m="1456000">and that works. OK, so I still need two and</span> <span m="1459000">three. Put a diode in there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1461000">Yeah, I guess you could. If the diode had the same kind</span> <span m="1466000">of impedance looking in, it kind of may work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470000">That's solution 4.2. I'm still waiting for solution</span> <span m="1474000">two and three. Pardon?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1477000">Cut off the cable? Exactly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1480000">So, the solution says, work on a different problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1485000">And that is solution number two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489000">OK, so the idea is, the root of all evil,</span> <span m="1493000">this long wire, which is why I had this thing</span> <span m="1498000">here. So instead, if I had short</span> <span m="1502000">wires, then what will happen is if it's a very small wire,</span> <span m="1507000">it'll look like this. And the wire's small enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1512000">I will see an itty-bitty thingamajig out there,</span> <span m="1516000">but not a whole lot. By the way, the fun thing is</span> <span m="1520000">that you can actually calculate the speed of light,</span> <span m="1525000">the experiment I just showed you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1528000">Can we put that up again? No, the big one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533000">So, in the experiment that I showed you, this distance was</span> <span m="1537000">about 500 nanoseconds, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1539000">This distance was 500 nanoseconds this time interval.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1542000">The length of this cable is about 500 feet,</span> <span m="1546000">somewhere around 500 feet. So you can figure out the speed</span> <span m="1550000">of light. What's the speed of light?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1552000">So, this is about 500 nanoseconds, and this cable is</span> <span m="1556000">roughly 500 feet. What's the speed of light?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561000">Roughly a foot per nanosecond. So, would you believe that in</span> <span m="1564000">6.002 we've figured out the speed of light from a simple</span> <span m="1568000">experiment? All right, so let's do the next</span> <span m="1571000">experiment now. Let's take out the long cable,</span> <span m="1574000">and connect a short cable instead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1576000">So, what I'm going to do is disconnect the long cable,</span> <span m="1580000">and instead, connect a small cable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">It's still relatively long, but much shorter than the 500</span> <span m="1586000">foot cable. So what you should see happen</span> <span m="1588000">now is that the little step should not be this big,</span> <span m="1592000">but much, much smaller. So, take a look up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1597000">There you go. OK, so with this thingamajig,</span> <span m="1600000">the little blip there is very small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1603000">And of course, if I make it even smaller,</span> <span m="1607000">then that can virtually vanish. OK, so that is solution number</span> <span m="1612000">two. So, we've done one,</span> <span m="1614000">two, four, 4.2. So, what's solution number</span> <span m="1618000">three? One more solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1621000">Pardon? So, another solution we</span> <span m="1624000">mentioned is we change this resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1628000">and that will work, if I make this very,</span> <span m="1631000">very low, then I'll get much closer to 5V here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636000">Yeah, that's a possibility. That's solution six I guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641000">So what was solution number three?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1644000">And you all should be able to solve this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1650000">You guys know the answer. OK, you folks should be able to</span> <span m="1654000">solve this. Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1655000">Ah, clock. So, what I can do is just as</span> <span m="1658000">was pointed out, that I leveraged my abstraction</span> <span m="1662000">by changing my VOH and VIH thresholds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1665000">So that'll work. The alternative thing is to use</span> <span m="1669000">a clock. A clock is a distinguished</span> <span m="1672000">signal that I send around in my digital circuit,</span> <span m="1676000">OK? So all I do is if I arrange it</span> <span m="1680000">such that my clock doesn't happen in this vicinity,</span> <span m="1684000">but rather, my clock happens late enough, then I'm going to</span> <span m="1690000">sample and look at my signals only on the rising and falling</span> <span m="1695000">edges of the clock, in which case I won't be</span> <span m="1698000">looking at the signal, but the signal is doing weird</span> <span m="1703000">things. OK, so a decent clock would</span> <span m="1706000">also solve the problem. OK, any last minute questions</span> <span m="1710000">before we go onto the next one? OK, the next problem that we're</span> <span m="1720000">going to look at is titled the Double Dip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1727000">OK, so what I'm going to do here is our Vs power supply,</span> <span m="1736000">and what I'm going to do is feed the power supply to an</span> <span m="1746000">inverter. OK, so we've been doing this</span> <span m="1752000">all along; Vs, I feed the supply to an</span> <span m="1756000">inverter. And what I'm also going to do</span> <span m="1760000">is, so this is ground, and I'm going to feed it to,</span> <span m="1766000">so feed the power supply connection to a couple of</span> <span m="1771000">inverters. OK, and what I'm going to do is</span> <span m="1779000">apply some sort of a signal to this inverter,</span> <span m="1787000">and I'm going to observe, and I'm going to look at this</span> <span m="1797000">signal here. So, the abstraction should tell</span> <span m="1803000">you that here's a power supply. This is 5V, or whatever the</span> <span m="1807000">supply voltage is to these two inverters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810000">That should be fine, and feed some sort of input to</span> <span m="1814000">this inverter, OK, and the output here should</span> <span m="1818000">be simply determined by this input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820000">This signal can have absolutely no bearing on this output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1825000">OK, and let's look at that and actually confirm it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1830000">So, I build a circuit like this, and we look at this</span> <span m="1835000">output, and initially there should not be any,</span> <span m="1840000">it should simply work fine. OK, so it should work now,</span> <span m="1846000">right? OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847000">So what you have here, this input here is the input</span> <span m="1853000">that I'm feeding to this inverter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1856000">That is a straight line. Is that the power supply?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1862000">It doesn't matter? OK, so I believe this is the,</span> <span m="1866000">we'll check in a few minutes, but I suspect this is the power</span> <span m="1870000">supply, and this guy here is the output looking here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1874000">So, the green one is the look here part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1877000">So, there must have been a one-to-zero transition here,</span> <span m="1881000">and that's all fine. So, so far, so good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884000">OK, no problem so far. Now what I'm going to do is I'm</span> <span m="1888000">going to do something to the circuit that as far as</span> <span m="1892000">abstraction is concerned, it doesn't show up on the</span> <span m="1895000">circuit. OK, it's below the abstraction</span> <span m="1901000">layer. OK, I'm going to do something,</span> <span m="1905000">and suddenly, some things are going to</span> <span m="1908000">happen. Look up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911000">The circuit hasn't changed. It's the same circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1916000">I've done nothing to the circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1919000">OK, look at the green output. I've done nothing to the</span> <span m="1925000">circuit that is visible here. OK, it's below the radar screen</span> <span m="1929000">here. It's below the abstraction</span> <span m="1931000">barrier. But, look at the disaster here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934000">OK, in particular, the spikes going up are not so</span> <span m="1937000">much of a problem. Because of the static</span> <span m="1940000">discipline, if I am at five or six or seven,</span> <span m="1943000">it doesn't matter as long as I am higher than VOH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1947000">So as long as I'm higher than VOH I don't have a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1952000">But the problems are these repeated dips.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1954000">OK, the dips are a problem here, which is why I labeled</span> <span m="1958000">this experiment the Double Dip. OK, the dips are bad because if</span> <span m="1962000">they are large enough, they can then group the output</span> <span m="1966000">down into the forbidden region, or worse yet,</span> <span m="1969000">make it look like a zero. OK, so you're not prepared for</span> <span m="1973000">this. So what I'm going to do is tell</span> <span m="1975000">you what I did to the circuit, and then ask you to help me</span> <span m="1979000">figure it out. So all I did was applied a load</span> <span m="1988000">resistance to this, I think of 50 ohms or some RL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997000">I just applied a load resistor. And this inverter here,</span> <span m="2008000">I believe, is a CMOS inverter that looks, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018000">So I have this input applied to this inverter,</span> <span m="2021000">and all I did is I applied an RL load here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2023000">And notice that the load here should not really change what's</span> <span m="2028000">happening if this is an ideal inverter, OK,</span> <span m="2030000">the load here should simply draw some current but really</span> <span m="2034000">should not change any other property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2038000">OK, so just remember, what's the signal doing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2042000">The signal is high. This guy turns on,</span> <span m="2045000">and current flows like this. So, let's say I had some sort</span> <span m="2050000">of a capacitor here. This charges like this,</span> <span m="2054000">and when it's slow, the PFET is on,</span> <span m="2057000">and current flows through here down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060000">And then when this goes high, this guy goes off,</span> <span m="2065000">and this guy turns on. OK, so the current flows out</span> <span m="2069000">this way and this charges through this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075000">When I turn it off, the P fret turns on and draws</span> <span m="2079000">current from the top. OK, so do we have any theories</span> <span m="2084000">as to why I'm getting that messy stuff, the dips and the spikes,</span> <span m="2090000">on the output of this inverter? So why does this inverter care</span> <span m="2096000">what the load of this inverter is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2099000">I mean, who cares? So, put your thinking caps on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2104000">Any theories? You guys did pretty well with</span> <span m="2108000">the previous one. And this is much easier,</span> <span m="2111000">actually. Need a better power supply;</span> <span m="2115000">OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace the power</span> <span m="2120000">supply, and instead, use a much bigger power supply</span> <span m="2124000">at 5V. A big, mongo power supply that</span> <span m="2128000">can supply 100 amps, and guess what,</span> <span m="2131000">I've made the changes, but guess what,</span> <span m="2134000">I still see the spikes. Good try, but it didn't work</span> <span m="2141000">out. Good try, good try.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143000">What next? Any other solutions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2146000">Yes? So dips are because of the</span> <span m="2150000">resistance, and the spikes are because of the inductance?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2156000">You're half correct. So, which one is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2162000">So, dips are because of resistances, and spikes are</span> <span m="2167000">because of inductances. You're half correct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2171000">It turns out that both the dips and the spikes are because of</span> <span m="2177000">inductances. OK, but be that as it may,</span> <span m="2181000">let me give you the next clue here, and then see if you can</span> <span m="2187000">come closer to the answer. So, what I've done here is I've</span> <span m="2193000">made this wire really, really long.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2198000">OK, it's a really long wire, OK, but it's a thick wire,</span> <span m="2201000">so it's a long, long, thick wire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2204000">So it's not the resistance. It's really,</span> <span m="2206000">really thick and mongo, and it's a long wire,</span> <span m="2210000">so a signal wire above a ground plane behaves like an inductor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2214000">And so here, it has the capacitance to,</span> <span m="2217000">but in this case it's inductance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219000">It's inductance here. So, I'll give you another ten</span> <span m="2224000">seconds to think about it and then tell you the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230000">But despite the inductance here, it turns out if I take out</span> <span m="2235000">this resistor, the problem goes away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239000">Look, I take out the resistor, the problem goes away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244000">Yes, there is an inductor here. OK, I take out this resistor,</span> <span m="2254000">problem goes away. I put the resistor back in,</span> <span m="2264000">boom. Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2266000">OK, pretty good. That's 86 points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2274000">So here's what's going on. There's an inductor here,</span> <span m="2283000">and when I put a 50 ohm resistor here,</span> <span m="2286000">I put this resistor. When the PFET turns on,</span> <span m="2290000">it draws a current. OK, it's going to draw a</span> <span m="2293000">current. It draws a current;</span> <span m="2295000">remember that across an inductor, I have a drop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2299000">And the drop relates to the di/dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2302000">Remember, for a capacitor, the current is Cdv/dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2306000">For the inductor, the voltage across the inductor</span> <span m="2309000">is Ldi/dt. So, if di/dt,</span> <span m="2313000">from switching a large current through the inductor every</span> <span m="2317000">cycle, OK, big di/dt, di/dt is large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2320000">I've made it large by having a very small RL,</span> <span m="2324000">so, you know, pulling a big current through</span> <span m="2327000">every few, whatever, every cycle,</span> <span m="2330000">and then stopping it. And so therefore,</span> <span m="2333000">I'm getting these big drops across this inductor that relate</span> <span m="2338000">to Ldi/dt. In other words,</span> <span m="2340000">the power supply here is fine. While you guys were watching,</span> <span m="2345000">I switched to the huge, mongo power supply,</span> <span m="2348000">and so this voltage is fine. But then this voltage after the</span> <span m="2352000">wire is the problem. So, this voltage here doesn't</span> <span m="2356000">look like this anymore. Rather, it has spikes that go</span> <span m="2359000">down, for example, and when I switch the other</span> <span m="2362000">way, they go up. OK, so therefore,</span> <span m="2364000">what I end up having here is big spikes on this power supply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2370000">And when this guy's power supply goes wacko,</span> <span m="2373000">then I see the spikes on its output as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2377000">OK, so what are the solutions for that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2380000">Any solutions here? What can I do to fix the</span> <span m="2383000">problem? Pardon?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2385000">Stop using the, exactly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386000">When in doubt, do something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389000">Build a different design. So what I could do is this is</span> <span m="2394000">pretty dumb, using a long wire. And so, no, but trust me,</span> <span m="2399000">oftentimes you go to the store room and they give you a big</span> <span m="2404000">roll of wire, and you're too lazy to cut a</span> <span m="2407000">piece out. Use the whole roll,</span> <span m="2410000">and use the two ends, and connect it in,</span> <span m="2413000">OK? So, if I had a much shorter</span> <span m="2415000">piece of wire, then that can solve my problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2418000">But again, remember, what's small to you may not be</span> <span m="2422000">small to the circuit. OK, so let's say,</span> <span m="2425000">for example, I'm Intel, and I'm building a</span> <span m="2429000">10 GHz Pentium 6 processor. OK, it's 0.1 nanosecond is my</span> <span m="2433000">cycle time. There, even a small,</span> <span m="2437000">itty bitty wire can be a real problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2440000">OK, and so therefore, distributing power throughout a</span> <span m="2444000">one inch chip that's clocking at 10 GHz is a really,</span> <span m="2447000">really hard problem. And our own David Perreault,</span> <span m="2451000">who is doing one of our sections, is one of the world's</span> <span m="2455000">experts in this field. Distributing power,</span> <span m="2458000">something as simple as, how do I get 1V in a stable</span> <span m="2462000">manner to every single device on my chip?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2465000">It's a hard problem. OK, so now, you have to begin</span> <span m="2470000">feeding your power supply connections much like RC</span> <span m="2475000">circuits, OK, and you have to solve some hard</span> <span m="2479000">problems to be able to simply distribute power decently</span> <span m="2485000">throughout your circuit. So, what else can I do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2489000">Yeah? Say it again?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2492000">Ah, I can do that. I could use different wires to</span> <span m="2495000">connect each of the inverters. That's a good point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2499000">So here, the coupling happens because I connect the two</span> <span m="2504000">inverters way out here. So instead, I use a different</span> <span m="2508000">cable. I hadn't thought of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2510000">That's a creative solution. OK, so in fact,</span> <span m="2514000">if you build a chip, so we built this chip called</span> <span m="2517000">RAW in our group, and it has on the order of 10</span> <span m="2521000">million gates. And this chip we built with</span> <span m="2526000">IBM's technology, and it turns out that you don't</span> <span m="2529000">send power supply in through a pin and then connect that 1.5V</span> <span m="2534000">supply to all your gates. What you do is from that pin,</span> <span m="2538000">you then build special power supply buffering trees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2542000">And each tree, each leaf of the tree drives a</span> <span m="2545000">subcircuit. In other words,</span> <span m="2547000">if this is a chip, you have lots and lots of gates</span> <span m="2551000">throughout your chip. What you do not do is bring in</span> <span m="2556000">a power supply like this, and then connect.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2560000">You don't do that. That's the worst possible thing</span> <span m="2565000">you can do. It's an absolute disaster for</span> <span m="2569000">the reason just brought up. OK, so instead what you do is</span> <span m="2575000">divide up the chip into, say, four quadrants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2579000">OK, in our case, we have 16 quadrants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2584000">And then what you do is from this point, you take one wire</span> <span m="2588000">that goes to this quadrant, one wire that comes here,</span> <span m="2592000">one here, and one here, so that you're getting the</span> <span m="2595000">power supply very close to the source, and you have different</span> <span m="2600000">connections going to each quadrant so that switching in</span> <span m="2604000">this quadrant will not affect this guy because of the</span> <span m="2607000">inductance of this lead here. OK, and if you hadn't taken</span> <span m="2613000">6.002, you'd have been arguing with IBM, I don't want 16 wires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617000">I want just one wire. OK, so there are other</span> <span m="2620000">solutions, of course. There's a couple more solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2624000">One is that what you can do is part of the problem here is that</span> <span m="2629000">all my transitions are really, really sharp.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2632000">OK, so di/dt is very, very large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2634000">So, there's a whole new technique in design of digital</span> <span m="2638000">and analog circuits, which talks about,</span> <span m="2641000">maybe I should call it waveform engineering, OK,</span> <span m="2645000">or edge engineering. OK, it's also called edge</span> <span m="2649000">smoothing. The idea is that rather than</span> <span m="2652000">have very sharp edges in your circuit, you try to have</span> <span m="2656000">smoother edges. And when you have smoother</span> <span m="2659000">edges, OK, then your di/dt is now going to be less.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2662000">It's not going to be very, very high.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2665000">Rather, your delta I is spread out over a longer period of</span> <span m="2669000">time. Of course, that means the</span> <span m="2671000">circuits may have to run a little slower,</span> <span m="2674000">but that can also solve the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2678000">And in fact, that same smoothing of the</span> <span m="2681000">waveforms was also the solution you saw in the capacitive</span> <span m="2686000">coupling we saw a month and a half ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2689000">And let me show you the demo, and then close up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693000">Not working? OK, that's OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2695000">It doesn't matter. So if you remember the demo</span> <span m="2700000">from the lecture about a month and a half ago in capacitors,</span> <span m="2705000">I talked about a chip with two pins, and there was this</span> <span m="2710000">capacitive coupling between the pins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2714000">And because of this, if this waveform is switching,</span> <span m="2718000">then because of this coupling, you will end up getting,</span> <span m="2723000">if this is the signal here, you will end up getting spikes</span> <span m="2729000">on this pin because of the signaling of the other pin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2733000">And that's good old capacitive coupling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2739000">OK, and to eliminate this, what you can do is much like</span> <span m="2742000">with the inductance system, if you, rather than having</span> <span m="2745000">sharp transitions on this pin, if you have smooth transitions</span> <span m="2749000">that look like this, then what you can do is you'll</span> <span m="2752000">now spread delta V from here to here over a longer delta T.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2756000">OK, delta T has become longer, and because of that,</span> <span m="2759000">you end up getting much better behavior, and you don't end up</span> <span m="2763000">getting these spikes. So therefore,</span> <span m="2766000">if you want to build really, really fast circuits,</span> <span m="2770000">you have to be really careful. You can build fast circuits,</span> <span m="2773000">but watch out for them fast edges.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2775000">OK, fast edges are nasty. They kill you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2778000">That's something to remember as you build the next generation of</span> <span m="2782000">circuits. Well, thank you all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784000">I had a blast, and I hope you guys had fun</span> <span m="2787000">too. Thank you.</span> </p>

<p><span m="6000">OK. Good morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="17000">In the last lecture I did a little demonstration for you</span> <span m="23000">where I showed you a pair of inverters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="29000">And showed you that the output of the first inverter looked</span> <span m="34000">weird, certainly not like anything we have seen thus far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="40000">It looked like a slow rising transition like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="45000">And using that motivation we have begun our study of RC</span> <span m="50000">circuits. And in particular for today the</span> <span m="54000">lecture is titled "Digital Circuit Speed".</span> </p>
<p><span m="60000">We are going to look at the fundamentals of digital circuit</span> <span m="64000">speed. And it all boils down to an RC</span> <span m="67000">delay. By the end of the lecture,</span> <span m="70000">I am going to show you two numbers that you can look at a</span> <span m="75000">circuit and obtain by observation, multiply them out</span> <span m="79000">and you will get a good idea of the speed at which a circuit</span> <span m="84000">will run. It is pretty amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="86000">So as a quick review -- The relevant section for this</span> <span m="93000">is Chapter 10.4. As a review,</span> <span m="97000">we said to understand things like this we need to develop the</span> <span m="104000">foundations for RC circuits. And the example I covered was</span> <span m="112000">that of a very simple circuit that looked like this --</span> <span m="120000">An RC circuit of this form. And I also showed you that for</span> <span m="129000">an input of the form, input that steps from zero to</span> <span m="136000">VI at time T equal to zero. And assuming that the capacitor</span> <span m="146000">state at time T equals zero was zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="153000">What this means is that the capacitor starts from rest,</span> <span m="158000">so at time T=0, oops, this is VI,</span> <span m="161000">I'm sorry. So we assume that the capacitor</span> <span m="165000">starts from rest. At time T=0 I apply a VI step,</span> <span m="170000">capital VI. And then I want to look at how</span> <span m="174000">the voltage across the capacitor behaves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="180000">And we did a bunch of analysis. And at the end of the day,</span> <span m="185000">in the final demo in the lecture last time I showed you</span> <span m="189000">that the capacitor would behave like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="193000">It would start off at, oops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="195000">I am sorry. This should be,</span> <span m="198000">let's assume that started off at VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="201000">We get a different equation for zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="204000">So let's say the capacitor started off at VO,</span> <span m="208000">in which case VC at time T=0 is VO as expected.</span> </p>
<p><span m="214000">And we showed that the output would look something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="223000">After a long period of time this would come up to VI and</span> <span m="232000">this rise had a time constant of tau=RC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="240000">So we wrote the equation for this waveform.</span> </p>
<p><span m="243000">And this is the case when VI is greater than VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="247000">I would like you to stare at the circuit and this result here</span> <span m="252000">to get more intuition on what is going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="256000">At time T=0, VC starts off at VO as expected</span> <span m="260000">because I am telling you that is the case, that is initial</span> <span m="264000">condition. It starts off at VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="267000">Then this one steps to VI. There is no infinite transition</span> <span m="273000">anywhere here, and so the capacitor holds its</span> <span m="276000">voltage at VO, at time T=0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="278000">And then the VI here, which is greater than VO,</span> <span m="281000">begins to charge the capacitor up, charge it through this</span> <span m="285000">resistor. And so therefore the capacitor</span> <span m="288000">charges up. After a long period of time,</span> <span m="291000">from the basic foundations of capacitors, we know that the</span> <span m="295000">capacitor appears like a long-term open circuit to DC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="300000">This is a DC voltage VI. So it appears like an open</span> <span m="303000">circuit. So after a long period of time</span> <span m="306000">VI appears at the end. And from here to here I have an</span> <span m="310000">exponential rise that is typified by an equation of the</span> <span m="314000">form -t/RC. This kind of waveform rising</span> <span m="317000">from a smaller value to a higher value is typified by this</span> <span m="321000">expression. We saw the expression when we</span> <span m="324000">developed the equations last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="328000">On the other hand, if the input was such that VI</span> <span m="332000">was smaller than VO, so let's say VI was smaller</span> <span m="337000">than VO then what will happen is that the capacitor voltage would</span> <span m="343000">start off at VO, because I am telling you that</span> <span m="348000">is the initial condition, and would then decay in this</span> <span m="353000">manner to the final value of VI which is the input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="360000">Instead of going up this way it decays down to the final value</span> <span m="365000">applied to the circuit. Again, the time constant is RC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371000">But this is typified by a form, this is exponential rise and</span> <span m="377000">this guy e^-t/RC is an exponential decay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="380000">The key thing to remember is that when you have RC circuits</span> <span m="386000">of this form, the waveforms that you get are</span> <span m="390000">either each of the e^-t/RC or 1-e^-t/RC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="396000">So you can now begin to see how waveforms such as that come</span> <span m="401000">about. We will do an example and sit</span> <span m="404000">down and compute the inverter delay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="407000">And notice that this waveform here is very typical or</span> <span m="411000">corresponds to this waveform that we see here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="415000">Here I am starting at VO. And assuming this axis starts</span> <span m="422000">off at zero, this one starts very close to zero and then</span> <span m="429000">rises up to some final value. So far I have reviewed some</span> <span m="436000">material for you that I covered the last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="442000">As a second step, I would like to give you a much</span> <span m="448000">more intuitive approach -- -- that doesn't involve solving</span> <span m="455000">any differential equations. And the reason I do this is</span> <span m="459000">that most experienced circuit designers do not sit down and</span> <span m="463000">write differential equations each time they see an RC</span> <span m="467000">circuit. When you are starting out and</span> <span m="470000">you see an RC circuit, you say node method and you</span> <span m="473000">write the differential equation, but experienced people don't do</span> <span m="478000">that. They look at it and they can</span> <span m="481000">sketch the waveform out by inspection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483000">And I will show you how to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485000">It is indeed incredibly simple once I give you some intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="489000">Throughout the rest of this course, I will be showing you</span> <span m="492000">many such examples where initially I develop the</span> <span m="495000">foundations of stuff and then show you an intuitive approach</span> <span m="498000">that very quickly lets you either get the final answer or</span> <span m="502000">at least sanity check the answer that you have gotten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="505000">And this is how experienced circuit designers deal with</span> <span m="508000">stuff. How many people here have seen</span> <span m="512000">this movie Bend it Like Beckham? So you know this Beckham</span> <span m="515000">character doesn't think about how he is going to curve the</span> <span m="519000">ball. He just does it and it happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522000">He doesn't sit down writing differential equations to find</span> <span m="525000">out the projectile trajectory and all of that stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="529000">You just kind of do it. These series of intuitions I am</span> <span m="533000">going to give you is going to be in line with the Bend it Like</span> <span m="537000">Beckham kind of intuition. And this one in particular I</span> <span m="542000">would like to do in honor of one of your recitation instructions</span> <span m="548000">Professor David Perreault. And so this piece of intuition</span> <span m="554000">is going to be termed "Practice it Like Perreault".</span> </p>
<p><span m="559000">Watch what I do with the other names.</span> </p>
<p><span m="562000">Professor David Perreault is really a world expert in</span> <span m="568000">designing really incredible power supplies for very,</span> <span m="573000">very small chips and so on. He doesn't start writing</span> <span m="579000">differential equations to do this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="583000">He looks at it and sketches it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="587000">Let me show you how he would do this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="591000">Suppose I have my circuit like before, VI, R and C,</span> <span m="597000">and I am telling you that VC(0)=VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="602000">And my input VI is a step that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="609000">VI is a step. How would Professor Perreault</span> <span m="616000">do this? Let's do it completely by</span> <span m="622000">intuition. No math here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="626000">All right. We know that I have told you</span> <span m="631000">that this guy starts off at VO. I am telling you that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="635000">You know it is going to start at VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="638000">And there is no impulse or huge infinite transition,</span> <span m="642000">and so the capacitor starts off at VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="646000">We also know from basic capacitor properties that after</span> <span m="650000">a long period of time, in the steady state,</span> <span m="654000">this is but a DC voltage. If you apply a DC and here is</span> <span m="658000">my capacitor. After a long period of time</span> <span m="662000">this guy is going to look like an open circuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="665000">It is going to charge up to some value and then is going to</span> <span m="668000">look like an open circuit. Because if it didn't,</span> <span m="671000">you would keep charging it and its voltage would keep</span> <span m="674000">increasing. That doesn't happen,</span> <span m="676000">it looks like an open circuit. So it looks like an open</span> <span m="679000">circuit in the long run. The voltage across it must be</span> <span m="683000">capital VI. If I don't have current flowing</span> <span m="685000">in the circuit then the only way that can happen is --</span> <span m="690000">This open circuit. Capital VI appears across the</span> <span m="694000">capacitor. Well, after a long period of</span> <span m="697000">time I know that the output must look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="701000">In this case, I have assumed VI is greater</span> <span m="705000">than VO. So you have two points of your</span> <span m="708000">curve, VO and VI after a long period of time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712000">And, as I told you earlier, with capacitors you get two</span> <span m="717000">kinds of curves. Two things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="721000">What you do is go zoop. There you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="724000">You're done. And this has an exponential</span> <span m="728000">rise. This is with the form</span> <span m="731000">1-e^-t/RC. So we can write an equation for</span> <span m="735000">that as follows. VC we know has something to do</span> <span m="740000">with minus t/RC. This is of that form,</span> <span m="743000">so there has to be that term in there somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="750000">And I start off with VO. At time T=0 this is one and</span> <span m="754000">this is one, so this term becomes a zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758000">At time T=0 that becomes a zero so I get VO here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762000">I am going to make sure this stuff stays zero at time T=0,</span> <span m="768000">so I start off with VO. Now, as time wears on what</span> <span m="772000">happens here? This voltage here,</span> <span m="775000">VI-VO, if you look at this difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="780000">That is exponentially decaying over time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="784000">And so therefore all I have to do here is write VI-VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="789000">There is the answer. I know the form of the curve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794000">I am just fitting an expression that meets this form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="799000">This starts off at VO. When time T=0 this second</span> <span m="804000">expression is zero and so it is VO.</span> </p>
<p><span m="809000">And this difference here decays down to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="812000">And this difference here, VI-VO is multiplied by this</span> <span m="817000">term here and that is what I get.</span> </p>
<p><span m="820000">And you can confirm this. At time T=0 this is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="825000">At time T infinity this goes to zero, this goes to zero leaving</span> <span m="830000">a one, and VO and minus VO cancel and I get a VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="836000">Virtually any such simple voltage source,</span> <span m="839000">current source, resistor, capacitor,</span> <span m="842000">circuit for most inputs like steps and so on can be analyzed</span> <span m="847000">in this manner. Initial value,</span> <span m="850000">final value, it's simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852000">And just to show you that this is simple, I am going to label</span> <span m="857000">this expression this way. It is of the form 1-e^-t/RC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="861000">Just remember that. Now, by the same token,</span> <span m="865000">what if VI had been smaller than VO?</span> </p>
<p><span m="870000">Then that is simple, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="872000">I would have had my VI being here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="875000">VI would have been here. And that is of the form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880000">In this particular situation, here is my VI,</span> <span m="884000">my starting value and I do this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="887000">And just to label that, let me label that this way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="891000">I just told you that for RC circuits you go this way or you</span> <span m="897000">go this way. So it is down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902000">I get some kind of an exponential decay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="906000">And, like before, think of this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="910000">This one has VI as a base value here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="914000">And the difference between the two is VO minus VI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="920000">And that difference decays. So I have a VI out here,</span> <span m="925000">and this difference decays so I get VO-VI and that decays in</span> <span m="932000">this form. So I get an exponential decay</span> <span m="937000">of this difference here. Just stare at it for a while</span> <span m="941000">longer. You should be able to just go</span> <span m="944000">and knock it off like this, just like Professor Perreault</span> <span m="949000">would. No differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="951000">Just write it down by looking at the curve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955000">Let's keep these two in mind, OK, these forms?</span> </p>
<p><span m="960000">One is the 1-e^-t/RC form and the e^-t/RC.</span> </p>
<p><span m="965000">Both have a time constant RC. Let me just make this a dashed</span> <span m="972000">line just to be on the safe side here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="990000">That is our first piece of intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="992000">And, as I pointed out before, in problems you face in life or</span> <span m="997000">in ones that we give you, feel free to use the intuitive</span> <span m="1002000">method. Or what you can do is apply the</span> <span m="1005000">mathematical method and then check your answer by using your</span> <span m="1009000">intuition. What I would like to do next is</span> <span m="1012000">apply what you have learned so far to figure out what we set</span> <span m="1017000">out to figure out, which is the delay of my</span> <span m="1021000">inverter. I had promised you that by the</span> <span m="1025000">end of this lecture I was going to close the loop on that little</span> <span m="1029000">demo. I was going to close the loop</span> <span m="1032000">for you on this little circuit that we had looked at,</span> <span m="1035000">one inverter driving another inverter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1038000">This was A, this was inverter X, and this was my node B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042000">The green curve you see out there, the middle one has a</span> <span m="1046000">transition shown up there. And what I am going to do next</span> <span m="1051000">is use the results we have gotten so far to compute a</span> <span m="1055000">number. We are going to compute a delay</span> <span m="1059000">number both for a rising transition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1062000">We will call that delay DR for rising transition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066000">And we will compute a delay for the falling transition DF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1071000">Remember, that this is the input that falls down sharply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1075000">The intermediate node B rises much more slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1081000">And because this rises much more slowly this guy here falls</span> <span m="1085000">a little after this transition here, and so there is a delay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1090000">And I am going to apply what we have learned so far and do an</span> <span m="1094000">example for you and figure out what that delay is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1098000">This is an absolute foundational calculation done in</span> <span m="1102000">building digital circuits all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106000">It is remarkable that something so simple is used in designing</span> <span m="1109000">even the most complex of circuits to obtain very quick</span> <span m="1113000">ideas of what my delay will look like when I have some subcircuit</span> <span m="1117000">driving some other piece of subcircuit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1119000">Let me just draw a few equivalent circuits for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1122000">The internal circuit looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1131000">This is my inverter X, A, my node B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1137000">And notice that I have this capacitor CGS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145000">Since I am interested in this node, let me show you that,</span> <span m="1149000">this capacitor explicitly, it is because of this capacitor</span> <span m="1153000">here that arises because of this MOSFET here between the gate and</span> <span m="1158000">the source. And that capacitor gives rise</span> <span m="1162000">to this RC thing that we are seeing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1164000">This is RL, this is RL, VS, VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1168000">And let's say, just as up there,</span> <span m="1172000">at time T=0 I get a transition like so, a falling transition</span> <span m="1180000">from say 5 volts to 0 volts at the node A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1186000">This is VA here. That is shown up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1191000">And VB --</span> <span m="1203000">We had expected that VB would look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1207000">We expected VB to be instantaneous and looking like</span> <span m="1212000">that, but instead because of the capacitor VB looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1218000">And remember, again, this is of the form</span> <span m="1222000">1-e^-t/RC. And we will write down the</span> <span m="1225000">answers by inspection. From this let me draw the</span> <span m="1231000">connection to circuit delay by showing you another little graph</span> <span m="1239000">here t, VB, zero. And what I am going to show</span> <span m="1244000">you, this is 5 volts. And so the output goes like</span> <span m="1250000">this from close to zero to 5 volts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1254000">It is close to zero. Because, at least with the</span> <span m="1259000">inverters we have been seeing in lab and so on,</span> <span m="1263000">the RON for the inverter is very, very small compared RL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266000">So it is virtually zero down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1269000">And so what is the delay? I mentioned there are two</span> <span m="1272000">delays of interest. One is the rising delay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1275000">That is the logical value at the end, if I wait a long enough</span> <span m="1279000">period of time, is a logical one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1283000">Delay is simply defined as starting from here how long does</span> <span m="1288000">this output take to get to a valid one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1292000">At what voltage here can I say that this transition corresponds</span> <span m="1298000">to a logical one? At what voltage here can I say</span> <span m="1302000">that that represents a valid one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1305000">Any ideas? Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1307000">It depends on the discipline, bingo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1310000">So it depends on the discipline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1313000">Now let's get more specific. Since it depends on the</span> <span m="1320000">discipline, at what value based on something in the discipline</span> <span m="1326000">can I say this thing is a logical one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330000">This is an output remember. VOH, bingo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1335000">There is some VOH somewhere. And it takes some amount of</span> <span m="1340000">time to get to a valid logical one output, ergo there is your</span> <span m="1347000">delay. This is tR.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1349000">And I call this the rising delay of the inverter X.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1356000">It is interesting that the rising delay of inverter X,</span> <span m="1360000">based on our model, depends on the parameters of</span> <span m="1365000">this inverter and the parameters of whatever it is driving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1370000">So remember that the delay is not necessarily just the</span> <span m="1375000">property of the inverter itself, but it depends on the context.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382000">If I stick my inverter before another inverter like this,</span> <span m="1385000">it is the capacitance on that inverter by our model that tells</span> <span m="1389000">me what the delay is going to look like, of course in addition</span> <span m="1393000">to RL. And we will do the math in a</span> <span m="1395000">few seconds. By the same token,</span> <span m="1397000">if I had this wire connecting not to one inverter but going to</span> <span m="1401000">ten other inverters, I expect to have a capacitance</span> <span m="1404000">equal to ten times CGS. And so therefore this thing</span> <span m="1407000">should rise even more slowly, correct?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1411000">The more capacitance on here the slower it rises up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415000">Simple. If I put more and more load on</span> <span m="1417000">this line by putting more and more MOSFETs on that line,</span> <span m="1422000">more and more inverters this will rise slower.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1425000">In our example I just have one, so let's go ahead and compute</span> <span m="1430000">the delay. This is called the rising delay</span> <span m="1433000">of X. That says that for this node</span> <span m="1436000">here to go from its output value to a valid one,</span> <span m="1439000">which is VOH how long does it take?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1444000">Notice that if this capacitor was zero then you would have</span> <span m="1449000">seen an instantaneous transition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1451000">If you have an instantaneous transition then notice that the</span> <span m="1457000">rising delay was zero. That was the model we had</span> <span m="1461000">looked at up until learning about capacitors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1465000">So let's go ahead and compute the number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470000">I can draw an equivalent circuit for computing a rising</span> <span m="1474000">delay. The equivalent circuit for the</span> <span m="1477000">rising delay looks like the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1480000">The VS voltage source, with a resistor RL and a</span> <span m="1484000">capacitor CGS, because when I turn this guy</span> <span m="1488000">off, this guy has gone off, and so as far as the rise time</span> <span m="1493000">of this node is concerned I can look at this circuit,</span> <span m="1497000">ground through CGS through RL through VS back to ground.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1504000">And just for simplicity, let me draw this in a form that</span> <span m="1507000">we understand.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1513000">CGS. Let me use this as my ground</span> <span m="1516000">node. And this is the voltage VB.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1520000">And this is RL. And V is simply VS once that</span> <span m="1525000">transition happens. My other equations here,</span> <span m="1531000">VI=VS. And what is VB(0)?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533000">VB(0) is at what value does this node start out?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1538000">Notice that for simplicity here if this RON is much,</span> <span m="1544000">much smaller than RL, then this node would be very</span> <span m="1549000">close to ground. So I will just go ahead and say</span> <span m="1554000">that VB at T=0 is approximately zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1559000">And then what I want to find out is what does the value look</span> <span m="1564000">like for time starting from zero and then going forward?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1569000">Well, we have become experts at this now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1578000">Let's do the intuition here. Start off with zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1581000">That's good. Because my initial value is</span> <span m="1584000">zero, I start off here. What is the final value?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1589000">After a long time, since this is a DC voltage,</span> <span m="1594000">what would be the value at VB after a long time?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1600000">Pardon? VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602000">If I wait long enough then it is going to be at VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1608000">This is greater than the initial value,</span> <span m="1613000">so we're done. That is my 1-e^-t/RC form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1620000">It took me three seconds there. It's pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1625000">We could add the expression for this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1630000">And the expression was I take my starting value,</span> <span m="1636000">which is zero, and I add to that this</span> <span m="1640000">difference VS and I multiply that by this form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1646000">There we go. And remember I get this from</span> <span m="1651000">that rising form up here. V0=0, this is zero,</span> <span m="1655000">so it is simply VI times that, and VI=VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1659000">I really would like you to get this intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1663000">If I had two choices, one is that you understand the</span> <span m="1668000">intuition and are able to sketch that versus in your sleep be</span> <span m="1674000">able to solve the differential equation and get to the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681000">I would much rather you get the intuition, if it is one or the</span> <span m="1687000">other. It is very simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690000">Start off at zero, I go chuck, and boom,</span> <span m="1694000">I get to VS and this is my 1-e^-t/RC form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1698000">I need to compute tR. And tR is the time that this</span> <span m="1703000">takes to get to VOH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1716000">For what value of time, for what T, does VB reach VOH?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1733000">I want to find tR. What's tR?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1741000">From that equation, that simply tells me the</span> <span m="1745000">trajectory of VB as a function of time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1750000">And so I need to find out what is T for which VB is VOH?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1756000">I write VOH=VS (1-e^-t/RC). So after a rise time my output</span> <span m="1762000">is going to be VOH. And so let me go ahead and find</span> <span m="1768000">tR. Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1771000">I bring this to this left-hand side and divide VOH by VS,</span> <span m="1777000">and then I move things around and what I end up getting is</span> <span m="1783000">-tR/RC and on the other side I get ln(1-VOH/VS).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789000">Divide VOH by VS, that is this,</span> <span m="1792000">move this to the other side, and move e^-t/RC to this side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1800000">And take logarithms on both sides.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1805000">This is what I get. tR is therefore -RLCGS</span> <span m="1811000">ln(1-VOH/VS). That is my rise time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1816000">You can just do this by inspection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1821000">It is just so awfully simple. Just to give to some intuition</span> <span m="1830000">with numbers and so on. Let's say that RL=1K,</span> <span m="1838000">VS=5 volts, VOH=4 volts, CGS=0.1 pF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1841000">This happens so often that we often time call it "puff".</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847000">0.1 puff. It is pF, it's called puff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851000">If it is nF, I don't know why they didn't</span> <span m="1855000">call it "nuff". They just call it nanofarads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1861000">TR for these numbers gets to be one times ten to the three times</span> <span m="1868000">point one times ten to the minus twelve for pico-farads</span> <span m="1874000">ln(1-4/5). And if you do the math you get</span> <span m="1879000">this down to 0.16 nanoseconds. This means that if I had an</span> <span m="1886000">inverter like that droving another inverter then my output</span> <span m="1893000">transition would be delayed by 0.16 nanoseconds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1900000">Trust me, when Intel builds microprocessors or when Broadcom</span> <span m="1905000">builds its cable modem chips, they have to do this one way or</span> <span m="1910000">the other using a computer tool or by hand for virtually every</span> <span m="1916000">little subcircuit in their chip. That is how you get the delays</span> <span m="1923000">or some approximation thereof. What I want you also to do is,</span> <span m="1929000">for no particular reason, I will just compute for you the</span> <span m="1935000">following quantity RLCGS. The time constant of that</span> <span m="1940000">circuit for no reason at all. I am just going to compute it</span> <span m="1946000">and stick it here. And RLCGS 1 K times 1 pF is</span> <span m="1951000">simply 0.1 nanoseconds. I am just writing it and</span> <span m="1957000">sticking it there for no particular reason.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1962000">The next step let's do the falling delay,</span> <span m="1966000">DF. That is the rising delay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969000">And, although I didn't show this to you in the demo,</span> <span m="1974000">there is a corresponding delay of the fall time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1981000">It doesn't fall instantly, but rather it falls rather</span> <span m="1985000">slowly. Let's draw the equivalent</span> <span m="1988000">circuit for when the node X falls.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1991000">Notice that in my inverters here, this node starts off being</span> <span m="1996000">at VS. This is high.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997000">And this is going to fall because when I turn this</span> <span m="2001000">transistor on it is going to pull this node to ground or it</span> <span m="2006000">is going to fall down. And what is the equivalent</span> <span m="2012000">circuit? The equivalent circuit is that</span> <span m="2015000">ground through capacitor to this node.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018000">At this node I have RON connecting to ground and I have</span> <span m="2022000">RL connecting to ground through VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2025000">Let me draw that little circuit for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028000">Remember life begins and ends on storage elements,</span> <span m="2032000">so I will draw them first. My storage element CGS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2036000">That is VB. And, as I said,</span> <span m="2041000">this is node X, it goes from RON to ground,</span> <span m="2047000">and it also goes through RL through VS to ground.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055000">And in this particular situation VB of zero for the</span> <span m="2063000">following delay, VB starts off at VS so VB of</span> <span m="2069000">zero is VS. And the final output I am not</span> <span m="2075000">sure yet. What is the final value of the</span> <span m="2079000">voltage at this node? I don't know that yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2084000">I need to compute that. So what I will do is whenever</span> <span m="2089000">you see something like this, a capacitor connecting to</span> <span m="2094000">linear stuff, or a nonlinear element</span> <span m="2098000">connecting to linear stuff. For no apparent reason you</span> <span m="2103000">should at least think about what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2105000">Think Thevenin, exactly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107000">And then see if you can use the Thevenin method to simplify your</span> <span m="2111000">life. Capacitor, a bunch of stuff</span> <span m="2113000">here, I need to find out the initial value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2116000">Oh, I know that. That is VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2118000">Done. I need to find the final value</span> <span m="2120000">using my intuitive method. For the final value,</span> <span m="2123000">I could do it just by looking at this, but I wanted to throw</span> <span m="2127000">in Thevenin. Hey, let me try to the Thevenin</span> <span m="2132000">equivalent and see if that makes my life any easier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2137000">VTH. The Thevenin method says that</span> <span m="2140000">you can replace this circuit here with a Thevenin equivalent</span> <span m="2145000">of the sort for the purpose of determining what happens at this</span> <span m="2150000">node given that that is linear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2162000">So I need to find out that for the purpose of determining what</span> <span m="2168000">happens at the node X. I have to replace this with its</span> <span m="2174000">Thevenin equivalent. And I now need to find out RTH</span> <span m="2179000">and VTH. So I get RTH by looking in</span> <span m="2183000">here, shorting this guy and looking at the resistance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190000">So I look in like this, then I short this guy here and</span> <span m="2193000">I get RL in parallel with RON because this one shorts to</span> <span m="2197000">ground. So RTH is simply RL in parallel</span> <span m="2200000">with RON. This is a convenient notation</span> <span m="2203000">for RL being in parallel with RON.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2205000">And you all know the value of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2208000">It is another one of our very simple patterns like voltage</span> <span m="2212000">divider and so on. Resistances in parallel can be</span> <span m="2215000">computed as RL RON divided by RL plus RON.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220000">What is VTH? VTH is the open circuit voltage</span> <span m="2225000">here. If I take out this capacitor,</span> <span m="2230000">I want to find out what the voltage here is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2235000">Ah-ha, voltage divider. VS, the voltage divider here,</span> <span m="2242000">RL and RON. I could write this down as VS</span> <span m="2248000">times RON/(RL+RON). Remember you will see again and</span> <span m="2254000">again and again and again in 6.002 or any circuit stuff that</span> <span m="2257000">you do, you will see them all over Thevenin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2260000">Voltage dividers, current dividers,</span> <span m="2262000">resistances in series, resistances in parallel,</span> <span m="2265000">RC thing-a-ma-jigs like this. So if you just remember those</span> <span m="2269000">10 to 15 intuitive patterns then you are pretty much set for</span> <span m="2273000">life. It just comes on again and</span> <span m="2275000">again and again. Parallel resistors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277000">Voltage dividers. You should be able to write</span> <span m="2283000">down a voltage divider in your sleep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2287000">So this is what I have. Let me now write down</span> <span m="2292000">intuitively what I expect the node X to do just by inspection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2299000">Let's see. What is the initial value of</span> <span m="2304000">the voltage across the capacitor, intuitive method?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2311000">This is how Professor Perreault would do it, remember?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2314000">He would start off by saying ah-ha, initial value is VS</span> <span m="2318000">because I am told it is VS. I start off with VS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2322000">And so I start off here. What is the value after a long,</span> <span m="2326000">long time based on this circuit here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2328000">V Thevenin. After a long time this is a DC</span> <span m="2331000">voltage because that is a DC voltage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2334000">The capacitor looks like an open circuit after a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2340000">And VTH appears there so it is simply V Thevenin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351000">And then when you see those two, boy, I love doing this,</span> <span m="2355000">you go like this. That is the coolest part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358000">And then I am done. It is so simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2361000">Three seconds or less, I am able to tell you what the</span> <span m="2365000">delay of an inverter is purely by intuition,</span> <span m="2368000">completely intuitively. I mean I haven't done any</span> <span m="2373000">solving. It is just by observation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376000">Took this circuit, made my life easy,</span> <span m="2379000">Thevenin, looked at RTH, VTH and then sketched it by</span> <span m="2384000">inspection. Again, if you find that things</span> <span m="2387000">are really, really, really simple don't be</span> <span m="2391000">surprised. Once you get some conceptual</span> <span m="2394000">understanding things are indeed very simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400000">You can eliminate a lot of math just by staring at things</span> <span m="2405000">attempting to build up the intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2408000">As a next step what I can do is write down the expression for</span> <span m="2414000">VB. And I write down the expression</span> <span m="2417000">from a falling transition. How do I do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2421000">What was it? What is the method?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2423000">I take the lowest value of interest here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2427000">That is VTH. And then I add to that this</span> <span m="2432000">difference decaying exponentially.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435000">And that difference is simply VS-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2439000">And that decays exponentially. This form is the e^-t/RC form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2445000">And, boom, I am done. Many of you are wondering,</span> <span m="2449000">Professor Agarwal, if life was so simple,</span> <span m="2453000">why on earth did you have us mess around with those</span> <span m="2458000">differential equations to get here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2463000">You show us differential equations and then you don't use</span> <span m="2466000">them anymore. Well, that is a good question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2469000">The answer to that is that you need to understand the</span> <span m="2472000">foundations. Once you understand the</span> <span m="2474000">foundations you can find simplifying techniques to get to</span> <span m="2478000">where you need to be, but you need to understand the</span> <span m="2481000">foundations. You need to at least see why</span> <span m="2484000">things are the way they are at least once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2488000">Understand the foundations and then find intuitive ways of</span> <span m="2494000">getting your answers. So now my falling delay here</span> <span m="2499000">is, I start off with VOS and I need to get all the way down to</span> <span m="2505000">what value to compute. At some point here,</span> <span m="2510000">this is a valid one, at some point VB becomes a</span> <span m="2515000">valid zero for the output. And that is when I stop my tF</span> <span m="2522000">block. What is the value here for this</span> <span m="2526000">to be a valid zero? Don't all yell at once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531000">VOL. I simply had to figure out what</span> <span m="2536000">is the value of time, this is Page 7,</span> <span m="2540000">for which this expression decays down to VOL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2547000">So it is VTH+(VS-VTH) e^-tF/RC. Then I simplify this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2558000">How do I do that? VOL-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2564000">Then I divide that by VS-VTH. So VOL-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2573000">Divide that by VS-VTH. Take logarithms on both sides</span> <span m="2585000">and then multiply by RC. So I get tF is -RC log of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2594000">This is R Thevenin and this is CGS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600000">How did I get this? VOL-VTH divided by VS-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2610000">Take logs on both sides. And then multiply throughout by</span> <span m="2617000">-1/-RC and I get my tF. Done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2621000">Let's do it for the same set numbers, just that we add an RON</span> <span m="2630000">of 10 ohms. I will do this for RON of 10</span> <span m="2635000">ohms and compute the value for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2642000">tF=-RTH. RTH is RON parallel RL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2646000">This is 10 ohms. That is 1K.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651000">So 10 ohms in parallel with 1K is approximately 10 ohms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2660000">So let me just use approximately 10 ohms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666000">1 pF, that is RC times ln of VOL.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2673000">Oh, I need to give you a VOL. Let's say my discipline has VOL</span> <span m="2679000">being 1 volt. And so therefore I end up</span> <span m="2683000">getting a VOL-VTH divided by VS-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2687000">Since RON is much, much, much smaller than RL,</span> <span m="2691000">since RON is 10 ohms and this is 1K, most of VS will drop</span> <span m="2697000">across RL. This is a hundred times</span> <span m="2702000">smaller. Compared to VOL,</span> <span m="2705000">which is 1 volt, VTH is very,</span> <span m="2707000">very small. VTH will be on the order of</span> <span m="2712000">0.05, and so therefore I simply write down VOL here and say VTH</span> <span m="2718000">is approximately zero, and I get VS-VTH.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722000">This is approximately 5. So let me just say this is</span> <span m="2728000">approximately. And if you do it you will get</span> <span m="2734000">1.6 pico-seconds. Again, just for fun,</span> <span m="2738000">let me write the corresponding RC time constant for the</span> <span m="2745000">circuit, which is RTHCGS. So RTH is approximately 10 ohms</span> <span m="2752000">and CGS is 1 pF, so this is 1 picosecond.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2764000">Now you will understand why I have been writing this time</span> <span m="2768000">constant down. It turns out that the time</span> <span m="2770000">constant is a very, very important number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2773000">So you see an RC circuit, and you compute its time</span> <span m="2777000">constant for an RLC connection like this, it is the series</span> <span m="2781000">resistance times the capacitor. The time constant is a very</span> <span m="2785000">important number. And usually the circuit delays</span> <span m="2789000">are in the neighborhood of the time constant value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2794000">In this case this is 1 pS. That is 1.6 pS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2797000">And in this case we had 0.1 nS and 0.16 nS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2800000">So the time constant itself is a good indicator of what your</span> <span m="2804000">delays are going to be like. If you have no time,</span> <span m="2808000">you are sloshing your cereal down in the morning and you need</span> <span m="2813000">to know how long the delay of the inverter very quickly,</span> <span m="2817000">you have three seconds. Just do the RC and that is a</span> <span m="2822000">good first approximation. What I would like to do next in</span> <span m="2826000">the last three or four minutes is set up a little demo for you</span> <span m="2831000">for your recitation, and then your recitation will</span> <span m="2835000">cover it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843000">This is a true story. This really,</span> <span m="2846000">really happened. In this West Coast school,</span> <span m="2849000">which shall remain nameless, they had a chip,</span> <span m="2853000">they built a chip. And the chip had a bunch of</span> <span m="2857000">pins, as you might imagine. And the pin,</span> <span m="2860000">as you have a trace on a board, a wire on a board there are</span> <span m="2864000">some capacitance attached to wires, between the wire and</span> <span m="2867000">ground. And that is a capacitor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2869000">And they just called it a load capacitance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872000">It could have been 0.1 pF or 0.01 pF or something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2876000">What they found when they built this chip --</span> <span m="2880000">What they found was that the voltage here they expected to</span> <span m="2883000">look like this, this computer science</span> <span m="2886000">abstraction and so on, zero to one transition,</span> <span m="2889000">boom, it should look like this. But for the reasons we saw</span> <span m="2893000">today the observed transition was much slower and looked like</span> <span m="2897000">this. So the students said ah-ha,</span> <span m="2900000">let's speed up this chip. We can speed up the chip by</span> <span m="2903000">looking at the RL and RON of my driving inverters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2907000">And if I make RL small -- Notice if I make RL small my</span> <span m="2912000">delay is small. If I make RON small my falling</span> <span m="2916000">delay is small. So let's make really small RLs</span> <span m="2919000">and RONs and let's all have fun. Unfortunately,</span> <span m="2923000">what they observed was that by making RL and RON both small,</span> <span m="2928000">the RC time constant small they expected to see a much sharper</span> <span m="2933000">rise time. And this was the original.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2936000">But what really happened was -- They expected this to get</span> <span m="2941000">faster and kind of look like this, but what happened was</span> <span m="2945000">disaster struck. What they observed was</span> <span m="2948000">something like that. This is a real-life story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2951000">And so instead of getting something like this they go</span> <span m="2955000">something like this. And why is that a problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2958000">That is a problem because notice when I expect to be at a</span> <span m="2962000">zero, I got some spikes that went higher than VIL into the</span> <span m="2966000">forbidden region and did bad things to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2970000">So let me show you a little demo and show you that that's</span> <span m="2973000">exactly how the circuit is behaving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2983000">Notice that this is what I expect but this is what I see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2988000">Look at the purple curve here. Notice these spikes that are</span> <span m="2994000">showing up there. This is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2997000">They saw it happen. And why is this happening?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3001000">It turns out that what was happening was that the two pins</span> <span m="3006000">were next to each other. And I will show you a little</span> <span m="3010000">demonstration here. Let's see if you can figure out</span> <span m="3013000">why this was happening. Think of these as two pins and</span> <span m="3017000">the pins are close together. I am just modeling the two pins</span> <span m="3022000">with a role of wire. And what I am going to do is --</span> <span m="3033000">I am going to separate the wires and keep them far apart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3036000">It is like keeping my pins far apart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3039000">Hey, guess what happened? Those nasty spikes went away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3042000">But then I cannot keep my pins 1 meter apart on a chip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3046000">Your laptops are going to look 20 yards long.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3048000">You want the pins to be very close to each other so that you</span> <span m="3052000">can have many pins on chips and therefore have very small</span> <span m="3056000">systems. But then look,</span> <span m="3057000">I get the spikes. Any idea why that is happening?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3062000">Why is that when the pins are close together I get those</span> <span m="3066000">spikes? Any ideas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3068000">Somewhat? We just learned about</span> <span m="3070000">capacitors, so this must have to do with capacitors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3074000">There is this parasitic capacitor between the pins,</span> <span m="3078000">exactly. Here is what is happening.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3080000">Here is what I expect. I expect a nice square wave at</span> <span m="3085000">the output. But instead I have a pin next</span> <span m="3088000">to me. And I have a faster wave form</span> <span m="3091000">driving it. And so therefore there is a</span> <span m="3093000">parasitic capacitor here. And because of that I get</span> <span m="3096000">something called "crosstalk". And the model for crosstalk is</span> <span m="3100000">some resultant resistance with the parasitic capacitor and I</span> <span m="3103000">get those spikes. And the 6.002 experts saw the</span> <span m="3105000">solution. They said how do we fix this</span> <span m="3108000">problem? 6.002 experts said the way we</span> <span m="3110000">fix this problem if it is slow it may be better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3112000">Instead of having sharp transitions let me drive it with</span> <span m="3116000">slower transitions. Let's switch to the demo again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3120000">You will see this in recitation, but I will show you</span> <span m="3123000">the demo very quickly. I have a sharp transition of</span> <span m="3126000">the input, which is that yellow thing out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3128000">I am going to make the transition slower.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3131000">Switch to a triangular wave. And you will notice the spikes</span> <span m="3134000">go away. Oh, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3135000">That is the wrong one. The other one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3138000">There you go. The moment I switch to a slower</span> <span m="3140000">transition boom, the spikes go away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3142000">You want to switch back to square?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3144000">There you go. The 6.002 experts saw the</span> <span m="3147000">solution. Slower transitions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3150000">And you will do this example in detail in Section tomorrow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3153000">Thank you.</span> </p>
